:READ_ME_FIRST:
☞ =Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/

To use *HAP_Audio-Drama-Project-Template.Org* /(Org-Mode Audio Drama Project Skeleton /Template)/ for your own projects, perform the following steps: 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *Copy/Clone ALL of the:* ~../Audio-Drama~ *Folder:* /(and its contents)/ 

        Copy this template folder as your ="NEW-Audio-Project"= folder... 

        In order to use this Audio Drama Project Skeleton properly so that 
        default Settings work, you need to *copy the ENTIRE folder* containing 
        this file and *ALL its contents*, renaming it from: =Audio-Drama= to 
        =Your Specific Name= or =Title= of your new Audio Drama Project...

        Put your new renamed Audio Drama Project Skeleton /(folder)/ where 
        you normally organize your audio drama or podcast projects.

        =OK You Did That?=  =Now You Are READY to Start Your Story!=

2) [ ] =Start Sketching Out Your Story NOW Before You Loose It!=

      =NOTE:= You may be doing this because you have some fantastic story idea
             brewing in your mind and you need to write that down before you 
             forget!  =Right?=  Therefore... as soon as you clone this file,
             =STOP= and go immediately to the:

                   ~💡 Ideas Scratchpad Refile / ☞ Start Here!~ 

             section and read the ~:README:~ directly under that heading...  
             Then write your idea down quickly /(as per the README instructions)/ 
             to get your inspiration recorded before you forget it...  

             Later, After you have all your ideas sketched out and you are 
             ready to be in an ="organized mood"= /(rather than creative mood)/ 
             /This does not imply being organized cannot be a CREATIVE PROCESS/ 
             Then it is time to:

             =Come Back Here And Finish Setting Up Your Project...=

             *This Project Template is HUGE!*

             *Your Muse Can Easily Loose Her Inspiration!*

             =The ☞ Start Here Section is Your Remedy= 

             =Do That first!=

3) [ ] *Finish Setting up this Project LATER...* [0/3]

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Change it to /"Your Audio Drama Project's Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Also change this directive to: /"Your-Audio-Drama-Project's-Title.pdf"/ 
           That will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
           /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Compose /Your-Audio-Drama-Project's Description/ as a short 
           paragraph here...

    - *The* ~./media~ *Directory is ALL Set:* 

         Any external documents or images referenced by your audio project 
         should be placed within this ~./media/~ directory... This single ~./media~ 
         directory will serve media and external attachments for this and any 
         other extra audio drama ~.org~ files you may end up creating here, as well 
         as being the media repository used by LaTeX during publishing... You will 
         also be using this ~./media/~ directory to store finished sound media, 
         /(e.g., sound-effects, loops, music, etc.)/ that are called out within 
         the cue sheets /(also contained within this ~.org~ project)/ 

         This ~./media/~ directory may ALSO contain a SymLink to the media folder
         used by a =DAW Project= for =post production work= directly related to this 
         Audio Drama Project...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./bin~ *Directory:*

         This folder is needed to run programs that convert your ~.fountain~ scripts into PDF or other formats...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./auto/~ *Directory:*

         This is where your output ~.PDF~ files will be placed during export. 
         This folder is auto generated during org-mode LaTeX processing...

         LaTeX processing will not delete any prior files contained here... 
         Some of them will be updated, but will have backups...  Any files 
         you place within this folder will NOT be lost, unless you delete 
         them... This folder is a good place to store other temporary files 
         you may be creating, generating.. etc...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

         The files in here are automatically linked and included within this
         template. You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to
         customize the already customized tags, and export options.

         /They are allready set up correctly for the audio drama genre, and the category is all set as well... But you can and may modify the original files to fit your needs.../

4) [ ] =Ongoing Planning / Writing - Developing Your Audio Production:=

      /Change headings and structure to match your project's outline episodes-scenes-plots-characters, etc./ 

      *Start doing the Tasks within the Tasks section:*

      =Have fun doing this...=

5) [ ] =Export/Publish to PDF File:=

      The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the SETUPFILES above will 
      get this file looking good when exported as a Standard PDF file.  
      Once you have your project directory all set up as above you are 
      ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

         *Issue the following Emacs command:*

            ~M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf~

         *OR* If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys* /"Command Mode"/ Try Shortcut:

            ~SPACE e p~

         *OR Export to OTHER Formats:*

            ~C-c C-e~

            /(a pop-up will show allowing you to choose export method)/

      After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., a new *PDF* by the name of:
      ~My-New-Audio-Drama.pdf~ -and- ~My-New-Audio-Drama.tex~ will appear 
      within this project's directory...

      Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your existing
      ~My-New-Audio-Drama.pdf~ -and- ~My-New-Audio-Drama.tex~ files!
      /(make backups first if needed!)/
      You should probably copy these files to the ~./auto/~ directory as 
      well for safe keeping as backups...

      =If you chose the last option above= LaTeX will output files with other
      extensions for those other output formats... =NOTE:= SETUPFILES have not
      been created yet for other eBook formats.  /(This is a work in progress)/

      =If YOU EXPERIENCE LaTeX ERRORS:= 

         *Consult Buffer:* ~*Org PDF LaTeX Output*~

=These Instructions Were Last Modified:= <2022-09-09 Fri> 

So far things are pretty basic PDF which is good enough for Audio Production...
Your Printed output will not be a book, but rather printable drama scripts
which will be discussed in detail later... 

For other Book Projects here in the PubOps section, We will get fancy trying out other eBook formats later...

** ☞ Start Here!
:README:
   This Section is mainly to accommodate "seat-of-pants" writers
          /(Of Which I Have Been Accused Of.../
           /But I Also Crave The Planning Stuff)/. 

   I often come here for my [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html]["yak shaving"]] adventures...

   Use this: *💡 Scratchpad Refile* section as a quick place to 
   document ideas and inspirations as they come along... 
   You can refile them later... 

   Even if your quick inspiration was intended for elsewhere?,
   /(e.g., You become bored documenting tedious technical/ 
   /information when suddenly, out-of-nowhere, an idea for a/ 
   /new sci-fi scene in that screenplay episode you had in the/ 
   /back of your mind all day!, etc.)/

   =Ummm.... Parallel Universe?=

   =Sure!= You can put anything in here! We've got that covered 
         for you in this Start Here spot. %^)

   Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment 
   ideas =While they are still fresh in mind=

   =How To Use ???= 

      /Simply Come directly here and do what ever you want.../
      /"Your Crazy Daze are Covered!" Yay!/ 

   =The following Shortcuts= will Help you get started as 
   quickly as possible:

   - [ ] =Copy/Clone:= *NEW 🎙* ~S???~ <2022-09-09 Fri> *Scene Title:* 

         From: *💡 New Scene Ideas:* Below...

         =Copy the Template's Heading AND ALL ITS CONTENTS= 

         Place your Clone Directly ABOVE the NEW Scene Template
         from which it was copied...

         Change your Clone's Title to Your Own Title...

   - [ ] *Change the timestamp on your Clone Entry:* [0/1]

         =Type:= ~C-c .~ while cursor is sitting on the timestamp

         /i.e., Press: ~Ctrl-c~, let go, and then type a Period/ ~.~

         A date chooser panel will pop up...

     + [ ] *Press* ~ENTER~ *to auto accept today's date and time.*  

            The existing timestamp will change to TODAY...
            Leave the timestamp at this date for the duration
            it is a record of when this new scene Idea first
            got into your head...

   - [ ] *Start Writing!!!*

          Fill in Location Details, Write a Quick Summary, or simply 
          begin writhing dialog under the *📃 Fountain Script:* 
          heading...

   - [ ] *Don't stop Writing!* 

          Don't worry about formatting or organizing it until later, 
          after all your inspiration has passed and you are ready 
          to organize...

   - [ ] =TODO After You Are Done Writing:=

        + [ ] *Move this new Scene Idea into an existing Episode:*

             =MOVE= this Scene Idea /(structured as it is)/ below to
             an already existing *🎙 Episode* within the *🎙 Production:*
             Binder of this Project... 

             The Org-Mode Outline Level of your clone is all set to 
             fit perfectly under an existing *🎙 Episode* Heading...

             =OR CREATE a Brand New Episode= for this New Scene 
             instead... 

             /(It may even be the start of an entirely NEW Series!)/

        + [ ] *Continue Writing/Developing RIGHT HERE if needed:*

               If you are not yet sure where this new Scene should go
               AND you are still inspired to write... Simply continue
               writing and developing this scene in place RIGHT HERE...

               Don't Worry about what it is for or where to put it...
               It is still here in "dream state" which is GOOD...
               Don't scare away your muses when they beckon! 
               Get your story down first, no matter what state it 
               may be in... =GET IT DOWN=

        + [ ] *You Are Free To Go Out And Play Elsewhere Little Grasshopper*

               If after writing... You don't feel like organizing 
               now? =NO PROBLEM=... But come back later and organize 
               things... =OK?= Don't create a swamp in here! 
               /And don't forget to take/ /your bath tonight... ;-)/

   Having done the simple steps above any time you get inspired, you 
   will much later in life be able to tell your grand children.. 
   /"I got my first spark of an idea for that story back in Year,/ 
   /Month, Day, time, second"/ 50 years later! Now that is being 
   organized! LOL

** 💡 New Scene Ideas:
*** NEW 🎙 ~S???~ <2022-09-09 Fri>  Scene Title /(Template)/
:README:
   Here is the =ULTIMATE MASTER WORKSPACE= for creating, developing, and 
   updating a *new scene*...

   All ideas, plots, dialog, sounds, music, production notes, etc. for a particular scene within this episode are developed here solely...

   One of the accompanying fountain drama scripts for this *Audio Drama Project* ~.org~ file /(named after this episode)/ contains a compilation of all the /fountain script snippits/ for all scenes developed within this single episode...

   Some elements created here will become part of the accompanying fountain drama script for this episode... /(e.g., dialog, notes, narration, etc.)/ 

   The accompanying fountain drama script for this episode must be kept up to date with final drafts and latest edits made solely here...

   The headings within this ~.org~ file can be tracked using ~GTD~ tags, and a *log* entry can keep track of time worked on them... Once a scene is in final draft stage, it can be marked *DONE* and the fountain script for the episode will be updated to reflect that scene's final draft state...

   *What is a Scene?*

   Scenes form the fabric within episodes of audio or radio programs...

   Scenes are small packages of isolated events relating to a single unique thread/picture knitted into a defined situation where particular events related to that situation play out...

   The scenes don't necessarily follow in chronological order but they relate to each other in the mosaic fabric of the story as it develops... 

   If a scene changes abruptly to some other situation, that may mean that the scene is over and a new one is starting... Usually a change of environment triggers a new scene...

*** NEW 📢 Sound Cues:
**** Sound Cue /(CLIPS)/ Numbering Convention:

Sound Cues contain an identifying code number plus a short descriptive title... /(this way sound files can be sorted alphabetically and found easily when called for in a script (or cue sheet) during rehearsal or production time...)/

It's easy to call out these cues during a rehearsal... For instance, simply saying: /"SFX 102, 12, 25"/ and everyone will know we are talking about Sound Clip "25", playing in Episode 102, at Scene 12...

=Sound Cue Code Numbering Convention:=

  ~[SFX-E001-S001-C001]~
     \    \    \    \____ *Sound Cue #* /(or Clip #. 999 files/project)/

          \
           \____ *ID Mnemonic* /(Sound Effect, Environment Sound, Etc.)/

The numbering and naming of sound cues for an entire audio drama project are specified by using the Sound Cue Naming Convention above...

A Sound Cue Ending with the same ~C~ /(cue or clip number)/ may appear multiple
times within this entire Audio Theatre Project. This means that the same clip gets played multiple times within different settings, e.g., ~[SFX-E001-S001-C001]~, ~[SFX-E001-S025-C001]~, ~[SFX-E018-S013-C001]~, etc.  Common sounds like footsteps etc., appear many times. However, you may only have three or four versions of footsteps produced as clips...

=Special Case for:= /[SFX-E001-/ ~S000~ /-C001]/

If the above number contains scene number: ~S000~ This is a special number reserved for cues that play BEFORE the first scene or ANY scene in the episode where it may appear...

This is for things like The Entire Series Music Theme, Content with a Scope Beyond This Single Episode Alone, Orson Well's Historic Speech, /(lol)/ Whatever you want... These cues only appear at the very top of an episode's script, just before the first scene starts... By design, they cannot appear within Scenes...

=Note:= All Audio Drama Projects based on this Template will use the same 
       rules.. If identical Sound clips are needed by other projects, you
       will have to copy those associated files to the other project's media
       folder... /(i.e., they must be duplicated because other projects will/ 
       /ONLY look for sound clips within their OWN MEDIA Folders).../

       In Addition to this... Project's MEDIA Folders may actually contain
       Symlinks to the Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's MEDIA
       folder...

       Redundancy /(i.e., multiple copies of media files)/ is fine as long as 
       the sound files are not HUGE!!! If they ARE HUGE you may be better 
       to use a simlink...

       The actual sound file names will NOT contain Episode or Scene number,
       but WILL contain the Sound Cue Number, AND a very short description 
       of the sound itself...

       You have 999 different possible Sound Cue Numbers, which should be more than enough when combined with a short description to make ALL sound
       file names for a single project unique within their associated 
       media folder...

       TO make this manageable /(multiple project wide)/, all post production
       ready sound files for any given project shall be kept in the
       accompanying project's ~media~ sub folder... This sub folder may in 
       fact be a symlink to THIS Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's 
       MEDIA folder... All Audio Theatre Projects have an associated DAW
       Project where Recorded Dialog is mixed with the music, sounds, 
       everything... These two need to be linked together at the hip!

=Note:= Many *"stock"* sounds occur normally within multiple Episodes 
       throughout a production project... These identical sound files are 
       identified within the script by looking at the Cue number which 
       MUST be UNIQUE within any given project... The Episode and Scene
       numbers may change but if the Cue Number is the same you know
       that it refers to a single sound file /(used multiple times within
       the script)/

=Sound or Music?= Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a sound clip
                  is "music", "background sound", or "sound effect"
                  depending on the genre of the story etc... Use your
                  best judgment when naming and assigning a sound
                  file as "music" or "sfx"... You will be fine...

*** NEW 🎶 Music Cues:
**** Music Cue /(music clips)/ Numbering Convention:

Music Cues contain an identifying code number plus a short descriptive title... /(this way music files can be sorted alphabetically and found easily when called for in a script (or cue sheet) during rehearsal or production time...)/

It's easy to call out these cues during a rehearsal... For instance, simply saying: /"MUSIC 102, 12, 25"/ and everyone will know we are talking about Music Clip "25", playing in Episode 102, at Scene 12...

   using this: *HAP_Audio-Drama-Project-Template* 

   It is hoped that this process will give you a faster, efficient, 
   organized "bootstrapped" head start and teach some guidance about 
   how to properly organize, write, and produce an audio drama with a 
   clearer mind, inspired outlook, and renewed motivation...

\newpage

*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Step One - Write a Single Sentence Summary:

=Take An Hour And Write A One-Sentence Summary Of Your Production:= 
   
*Something like this:*

   /"A gourmet chef from Boston acedentally falls into a parallel/ 
    /world, almost destroyed by an arch enemy he did not even know/ 
    /he had, then he discovers he is immortal and meets-re-discovers/ 
    /his ancient soul mate of eons. Together they save the universe/ 
    /after all else fails!"/

OK I know... I cheated. The second sentence is a stinger. It needs to stand alone... I often buck the rules... lol

The sentence you end up writing above will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This exercise defines the big picture illustrated by the first simple triangle in the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and/ /classmates by Baby Bear in: Chapter 4 of Randy Ingermanson's Book:/ 
/"How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

Within that same chapter, Baby Bear also pointed out this important fact to keep in mind: 

   /(Illustrated "Radio Drama" Style Just For Fun, Because We Can... ;-)/

This is important, you novelists!
   
You're going to get lots of advice on how to write a novel.  
    
But that's all it is. Advice. If you don't like that advice, 
    
if it doesn't work for you, then ignore it.  
    
If it does work for you, then run with it.

#+END_SRC

I agree... Don't let anybody steer you away from your muses! But at the same time don't ignore the basics!

This synopsis stuff is basic to the bone! It is universal... We cannot buck it!  It's based on human nature... Your sentence above, will serve as a pitch during normal conversations /(to see if there is any interest)/...

=Memorize "your line"= to the point that you can say it in your sleep! Turn it into a "slogan" /(hopefully a "meme" if you are the lucky type)/. Your goal is that others will remember and be able to easily tell all their friends /(word/ /for word)/. Networking is the key! You can't do it alone... Songs are also great help! /(cartoons and songs are killer!)/ Social networks open you up to sky limit possibilities!

=Lead with your story line while engaging with a total stranger= or even your mother. =Remain silent after that=... Wait to see if there is interest before diving deeper... That and your good body language "posture" will take care of everything...

=Important!= Closing rules of sales dictate the law of attraction 
            always applies.. Pushing yields negative results... 
            =If you push people... They push back...= 

            =If you run away from people, they chase you...= 

            To eat, or to be eaten... That's what it all comes down to. 
            lol Wait to see if there is interest... 

            =If NOT, Move On...= 
            =If YES... Do The Next Step...=

When the time comes for you to Pitch Your Production Work, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It's the hook that will get executive producers coming to the table to talk business, to inspire your cast/crew, 
the sales force, the networks, and ultimately to listeners. So make the best 
one you can!

***** Here are some tips:

- *Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.*

- *No character names, please!* 

   Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".

- *Tie together the big picture and the personal picture.* 

   Which character has the most to lose in this story? 
   Now tell me what he or she wants to win.

- *Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list* 

   This will teach you how to do it by example. Writing a 
   one-sentence description is an art form. If you become a 
   master at this, marketing firms will want you madly!

- *Check out:* [[yt:feD-dImM4a8][LEGO Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 60 Seconds]] 

   /(and other 60 second movies like it)/ for a completely 
   different audio/visual parallel to this literary concept...

*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Two - Expand Summary to Paragraph

=Take another hour and expand your sentence= from step one into a full paragraph describing the story setup, major disasters, and ending of the series.

This step defines the second stage of the snowflake model... as illustrated by further trisections of the triangle producing the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and classmates by Baby Bear in chapter 5, "The Importance of being Disastrous" in Randy Ingermanson's book: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

For this step, *visualize the story as having "three disasters plus an ending"* 

For normal Fiction Authors, each of the disasters takes a quarter of a book (fiction novel) to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. 

Things are a bit different for an on-going audio drama production... You may have to overlap several *"Hero's journeys"* in parallel, and weave them into your episodes, as the story evolves over time... 

The reason for this requirement is because =EACH EPISODE is a MINI SELF CONTAINED Hero's Journey= that stands alone with a satisfying conclusion, but there is a teasing stinger at the end...

The stinger or *"cliff hanger"* at the end of each episode leads listeners
interest to continue with the next exciting adventure to come... /(another mini hero's journey)/

No one claims this to be an absolute ideal structure, but it's the one that Randy Ingermanson uses, and it has a strong basis in psychology.

You may find it easier to keep the main synopsis very short, but add mini synopsis for each episode using the same methods below...

=If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then:=

- *The first disaster would correspond to the end of Act 1*

- *The second disaster would be the mid-point of Act 2*

- *The third disaster would come at the end of Act 2, and force Act 3*

- *Act 3 wraps everything up*

\newpage

**** Make 5 Sentences: [0/5]
:README:
   =Note:= The steps below could be done to write a single
          synopsis for the ENTIRE PRODUCTION OR write 
          individual synopsis to include within EACH EPISODE 
          OR you combine BOTH methods above... /(i.e. One/
          /MASTER synopsis, and many individual EPISODE/
          /synopsis./
:END:

1. [ ] =Exposition:=

   This sentence's purpose is to paint the story setting, 
   backdrop and mention leading characters within a 
   descriptive role... The mood is set here briefly, 
   dripping with consentrated visions of expectation!

2. [ ] =Act One:= - *First Disaster Summary*

   The first disaster emerges out of circumstance. 
   This is the key event that motivates our lead character 
   /(hero)/ to find a remedy.  This disaster must hit home to 
   our readers as well, inspiring them along side our hero 
   as faithful evangelists... 

3. [ ] =First Half of Act Two:= - *Second Disaster Summary*

   The second disaster is the result of our budding hero's 
   attempt to "fix things" after the first disaster in Act One. 
   But things keep getting worse, not better.  As a result, 
   our hero experiences an epiphany, realizing the errors of 
   her ways, and resolves to do things the correct way from 
   that moment on... /(the music changes, new hope emerges)/

4. [ ] =Second Half of Act Two:= - *Third Disaster & Standoff Summary*

   The last half of Act 2 is the standoff between your hero 
   and villain or obstacle... Here is where your hero's new 
   resolve to doing the right thing begins to pay off.  
   However this act ends with the third disaster...  
   Act 3 will determine the final outcome.

5. [ ] =Act 3 Summary:= *(conclusion)*

   This is where it all previous conflicts are finally resolved, 
   one way or the other... Whether or not the lead character 
   /(hero)/ whatever succeeds or fails.  The story once resolved 
   ends as a comedy, tragedy, or mellowdrama...
   You decide on that...

\newpage

**** Using Your One-Paragraph Summary:

You will be using this paragraph in your proposals. It is only for your agents etc.  Not for your readers who need to be kept in the dark about how the story develops before reading the book! =Watch Out Spoilers!=

=However=, Some of this paragraph /(written with parts pourposefully left out or with questions put in place)/ may end up as promotional material and or short previews of your Audio Production.

\newpage

*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Three - Expand Paragraph to Synopsis:

=Take several hours to expand each sentence= of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. 

*All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster.* The final paragraph is the final conclusion to those disasters bringing your story to a close.

You can employ the snowflake method at finer levels here... Breaking each paragraph into mini disasters or turning points within the main disaster, etc.

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your audio production, and you have only spent a day or two, or at most, a week or two, but all that time will not have been wasted! You will now have a good idea if there are problems with your story. This is good knowledge to have now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft.

At the end of this exercise, you will have a nice one-page skeleton of your Audio Production as a whole or at least the first few episodes, each with their own self contained synopsis. It's fine if your skeletons do not fit all on one single-spaced page as long as they don't go beyond that... 

Your process now is to grow these ideas as episodes within your story. You are expanding the conflict. You have a synopsis suitable for a proposal, and you are well on your way to doing extended promotion...

\newpage

*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Completion:

- [ ] *Copy one-page skeleton from:* =Step Three= above to: *📃 Synopsis:* 
       inside the *🎙 Production:* Binder...

       when you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have 
       completed half the battle of producing your Audio Drama! The 
       other half is getting to know your characters... 
       Plots and chapters will flow from that effortlessly...

          Project...

   - [ ] =Use Your:= *👤 New Character:* Item as the repository 
          for the results of these tasks. Fill in sub items: 
          *💬 Profile:*, *📃 Character Synopsis*, etc. as you 
          follow along completing the tasks below...

   - [ ] =After completing each Timestamped Step= below, 
          Mark its TODO State To ~DONE~ & Update the Timestamp 
          to the current time as well...  
          Use Command: ~C-c . RET~ while cursor is on the 
          timestamp to update it to the current date/time...

          This is all to aid you while you are working on a
          new character... Once your character is reasonably
          set up... Reset all the TODO States to ~NEW~ for the
          next character you will be doing this for...

          You can also mark the TODO states of any of the 
          headings within your final Character Profile as
          you are working on them there...

   Some of these Character tasks are based on the Snowflake Method 
   as outlined in Randy Ingermanson's book:

         [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/]["How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"]]

   Other tasks are based on concepts outlined within the book:

      [[https://www.kmweiland.com/wp-content/uploads/crafting-unforgettable-characters.pdf]["Crafting Unforgettable Characters" by; K.M. Weiland]] 

   The second book is a free download from: [[https://www.kmweiland.com/][K.M. Weilands Website]] 
   where you can find other great books and writers resources... 

   Much of what you will be filling in below is based on the above 
   two books but no more instruction is given here as to the why or 
   how... Only dry forms have been included here to make it convenient 
   for you to complete this process...  

   =You are strongly encouraged= to purchase and read the above two 
   books so that you will have a deeper understanding while you 
   work through this process...

   The tasks within this section will be used to produce a
   *"Character Bible"* /(Binder)/ for each character in your story. 
   The Character Bible in turn will be used to create your
   character's Official Profile & Synopsis... /(which is a/ 
   /more formal and condensed presentation Binder without/ 
   /all the worksheets, interviews, and details...)/

   =A character bible is the private lifetime personell file= of a
   character...  It will hold scrapbook like items of importance 
   throughout the character's life...  

   There's a TV show on Amazon called: *"Hanna"* where this concept 
   has been illustrated perfectly! In this CIA black ops thriller, 
   Babies DNA are enhanced with wolf genes to make them grow up into 
   super soldiers... When these children get deployed 
   /(looking as normal youths/ /in high school)/, they are each assigned
   a scrap-book containing all of their *"character's"* vital details.  
   There are pictures of family, best friends, past events, etc.  
   Their photo is on the front cover...

   =All of it is fake...=, BUT as these secret CIA teens carry out 
   roll play /(within their fake role as normal high school students)/, 
   soon... they begin to believe more and more that they actually 
   "are" who their scrapbook profiles say they are and not trained 
   CIA agents anymore! 

   This TV Series does an excellent Job of Illustrating:

*** NEW 🎙 ~S???~ Scene Title /(Template - Change to Actual Scene Title)/
:README:
   Here is the =ULTIMATE MASTER WORKSPACE= for creating, developing, and 
   updating a *new scene*...

   All ideas, plots, dialog, sounds, music, production notes, etc. for a particular scene within this episode are developed here solely...

   One of the accompanying fountain drama scripts for this *Audio Drama Project* ~.org~ file /(named after this episode)/ contains a compilation of all the /fountain script snippits/ for all scenes developed within this single episode...

   Some elements created here will become part of the accompanying fountain drama script for this episode... /(e.g., dialog, notes, narration, etc.)/ 

   The accompanying fountain drama script for this episode must be kept up to date with final drafts and latest edits made solely here...

   The headings within this ~.org~ file can be tracked using ~GTD~ tags, and a *log* entry can keep track of time worked on them... Once a scene is in final draft stage, it can be marked *DONE* and the fountain script for the episode will be updated to reflect that scene's final draft state...

   *What is a Scene?*

   Scenes form the fabric within episodes of audio or radio programs...

   Scenes are small packages of isolated events relating to a single unique thread/picture knitted into a defined situation where particular events related to that situation play out...

   The scenes don't necessarily follow in chronological order but they relate to each other in the mosaic fabric of the story as it develops... 

   If a scene changes abruptly to some other situation, that may mean that the scene is over and a new one is starting... Usually a change of environment triggers a new scene...

*** NEW 📢 Sound Cues:
**** Sound Cue /(CLIPS)/ Numbering Convention:

Sound Cues contain an identifying code number plus a short descriptive title... /(this way sound files can be sorted alphabetically and found easily when called for in a script (or cue sheet) during rehearsal or production time...)/

It's easy to call out these cues during a rehearsal... For instance, simply saying: /"SFX 102, 12, 25"/ and everyone will know we are talking about Sound Clip "25", playing in Episode 102, at Scene 12...

=Sound Cue Code Numbering Convention:=

  ~[SFX-E001-S001-C001]~
     \    \    \    \____ *Sound Cue #* /(or Clip #. 999 files/project)/
      \    \    \
       \    \    \____ *Scene #* /(999 Possible Scenes/Episode)/
        \    \    
         \    \____ *Episode #* /(999 Possible Episodes/Story)/
          \
           \____ *ID Mnemonic* /(Sound Effect, Environment Sound, Etc.)/

The numbering and naming of sound cues for an entire audio drama project are specified by using the Sound Cue Naming Convention above...

A Sound Cue Ending with the same ~C~ /(cue or clip number)/ may appear multiple
times within this entire Audio Theatre Project. This means that the same clip gets played multiple times within different settings, e.g., ~[SFX-E001-S001-C001]~, ~[SFX-E001-S025-C001]~, ~[SFX-E018-S013-C001]~, etc.  Common sounds like footsteps etc., appear many times. However, you may only have three or four versions of footsteps produced as clips...

=Special Case for:= /[SFX-E001-/ ~S000~ /-C001]/

If the above number contains scene number: ~S000~ This is a special number reserved for cues that play BEFORE the first scene or ANY scene in the episode where it may appear...

This is for things like The Entire Series Music Theme, Content with a Scope Beyond This Single Episode Alone, Orson Well's Historic Speech, /(lol)/ Whatever you want... These cues only appear at the very top of an episode's script, just before the first scene starts... By design, they cannot appear within Scenes...

=Note:= All Audio Drama Projects based on this Template will use the same 
       rules.. If identical Sound clips are needed by other projects, you
       will have to copy those associated files to the other project's media
       folder... /(i.e., they must be duplicated because other projects will/ 
       /ONLY look for sound clips within their OWN MEDIA Folders).../

       In Addition to this... Project's MEDIA Folders may actually contain
       Symlinks to the Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's MEDIA
       folder...

       Redundancy /(i.e., multiple copies of media files)/ is fine as long as 
       the sound files are not HUGE!!! If they ARE HUGE you may be better 
       to use a simlink...

       The actual sound file names will NOT contain Episode or Scene number,
       but WILL contain the Sound Cue Number, AND a very short description 
       of the sound itself...

       You have 999 different possible Sound Cue Numbers, which should be more than enough when combined with a short description to make ALL sound
       file names for a single project unique within their associated 
       media folder...

       TO make this manageable /(multiple project wide)/, all post production
       ready sound files for any given project shall be kept in the
       accompanying project's ~media~ sub folder... This sub folder may in 
       fact be a symlink to THIS Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's 
       MEDIA folder... All Audio Theatre Projects have an associated DAW
       Project where Recorded Dialog is mixed with the music, sounds, 
       everything... These two need to be linked together at the hip!

=Note:= Many *"stock"* sounds occur normally within multiple Episodes 
       throughout a production project... These identical sound files are 
       identified within the script by looking at the Cue number which 
       MUST be UNIQUE within any given project... The Episode and Scene
       numbers may change but if the Cue Number is the same you know
       that it refers to a single sound file /(used multiple times within
       the script)/

=Sound or Music?= Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a sound clip
                  is "music", "background sound", or "sound effect"
                  depending on the genre of the story etc... Use your
                  best judgment when naming and assigning a sound
                  file as "music" or "sfx"... You will be fine...

          \
           \____ *ID Mnemonic* /(ID for Music Cues)/

The numbering and naming of music cues for an entire audio drama project are specified by using the Music Cue Naming Convention above...

A Music Cue Ending with the same ~M~ /(Music Cue number)/ may appear multiple
times within this entire Audio Theatre Project. This means that the same clip gets played multiple times within different settings, e.g., ~[MUS-E001-S001-M001]~, ~[MUS-E001-S025-M001]~, ~[MUS-E018-S013-M001]~, etc.  Common music like intro themes, exit themes, etc., appear many times... 

=Special Case for:= /[MUS-E001-/ ~S000~ /-M001]/

If the above number contains scene number: ~S000~ This is a special number reserved for cues that play BEFORE the first scene or ANY scene in the episode where it may appear...

This is for things like The Entire Series Music Theme, Content with a Scope Beyond This Single Episode Alone, Orson Well's Historic Speech, /(lol)/ Whatever you want... These cues only appear at the very top of an episode's script, just before the first scene starts... By design, they cannot appear within Scenes...

=Note:= All Audio Drama Projects based on this Template will use the same 
       rules.. If identical Music clips are needed by other projects, you
       will have to copy those associated files to the other project's media
       folder... /(i.e., they must be duplicated because other projects will/ 
       /ONLY look for music clips within their OWN MEDIA Folders).../

       In Addition to this... Project's MEDIA Folders may actually contain
       Symlinks to the Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's MEDIA
       folder...

       Redundancy /(i.e., multiple copies of media files)/ is fine as long as 
       the music files are not HUGE!!! If they ARE HUGE you may be better 
       to use a simlink...

       The actual music file names will NOT contain Episode or Scene number,
       but WILL contain the Music Cue Number, AND a very short description 
       of the music itself...

       You have 999 different possible Music Cue Numbers, which should be more than enough when combined with a short description to make ALL music
       file names for a single project unique within their associated 
       media folder...

       TO make this manageable /(multiple project wide)/, all post production
       ready music files for any given project shall be kept in the
       accompanying project's ~media~ sub folder... This sub folder may in 
       fact be a symlink to THIS Project's Accompanying DAW Project Folder's 
       MEDIA folder... All Audio Theatre Projects have an associated DAW
       Project where Recorded Dialog is mixed with the music, sounds, 
       everything... These two need to be linked together at the hip!

=Note:= *"stock"* music may occur multiple times within multiple Episodes 
       and Scenes throughout a production project... These identical 
       music files are identified within the script by looking at the 
       Music Cue Number which MUST be UNIQUE within any given project... 
       The Episode and Scene numbers may change but if the Music Cue 
       Number is the same you know that it refers to a single music file
       /(used multiple times within the script)/

=Sound or Music?= Sometimes it is hard to decide whether a clip is
                  /"music"/ , /"background sound"/ , /"sound effect"/ 
                  or, in many cases /a morph of all-the-above!!!/
                  depending on the genre of the story etc... Use your
                  best judgment when naming and assigning a sound
                  file as "music" or "sfx"... =You will be fine...=

:README:
   - *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:* /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

      =Punch the Time Clock= At the heading And then begin working on a
      task related to that Heading... =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= 

   - =Use These Commands:= /as you work to keep track your time.../

      + *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ 

           /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

           This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
           underneath the HEADING...

           Do this just before starting work on the task... 
           Be in control of your life!

           After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
           work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
           other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
           be recording your time all the while... You will see 
           in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
           as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
           and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

           /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

           You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
           while and you need to come back to update the item's
           info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
           do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

           This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
           ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the/ /clock)/

           The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end 
           timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

           =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e.,
           Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse,
           leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it
           again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do/
           /you want to do with this?"/ If you do something like 
           that you can always come back and directly edit the 
           clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing 
           clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

           ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

           This command will change the total time at the end showing 
           your new calculated time...

           If you need to go away and do something else before finishing 
           this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come 
           back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card 
           Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear 
           above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When 
           you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry 
           below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

           When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
           command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
           /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
           /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
           So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
           marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
           /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
           /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

           This removes currently running clock and forgets 
           any time accrued or associated with it...

      + ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:*

           /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
           =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
           within your org file with those timestamps!!!

   =Note:= Once all of the above commands become routine for you, you 
          might want to remove this ~:README:~ drawer from this 
          template... That way it won't get copied when you need to

   - *DEFINITION:*

      =From Wikipedia:= "In its most general sense, the term "world" refers 
      to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything 
      that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently 
      in different fields."

      *For Our Purposes as Fiction Authors:* Our Definition shall be a
      *"plurality of worlds"* Worlds which are Still =ALL encompassing BUT=
      =Not Encompassing ALL= so-to-speak...

      Worlds are Different than Regions because Worlds simply "exist" 
      without the influence of any outside artificial influence... 
      Worlds can be quite "nebulous" ♾ creatures! Regions are based on 
      defined formalized constraints...

   - *World Creation Can be Tricky:*

      If you fall into a black rabbit hole through the centre of the earth,
      /(Like Alice).../ What happens when you come out the other side?  
      Will everyone in China be upside down?

      Expanding on the confusing =ALL Encompassing= statement from our

      *New Worlds Created Here:*

      =A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not Contain One-Or-Many= *Locations/Regions*

*** NEW ✨ New Region: /(Master Template)/
:README:
   - *DEFINITION:*

      A Region Is Defined As: An "area" or "space" which is broadly 
      divided by physical characteristics /(physical geography)/, any 
      impact characteristics of inhabitants /(bio geography)/, and the 
      interaction of inhabitants with the area's environment 
      /(environmental geography)/. 

      The word *"region"* is taken from the Latin *regio* /(derived from/ 
      /regere, 'to rule')/ In mathematics the term: *"domain"* is a similar 
      concept to the generalized idea of *"regions"* as defined within 
      various geographical sciences: /(e.g., physical geography, ecology,/ 
      /biogeography, zoogeography, environmental geography, ethnography,/ 
      /etc.)/ And of course all of the *Exo-* versions of these as well...

      Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their 
      imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except 
      in the case where some governing body has defined artificial borders.

      Apart from geographic regions, there are also hydrospheric and 
      atmospheric regions. /(e.g., oceans, lakes, rivers, discrete/ 
      /climates of elevations above sea level)/... Add to this the 
      infinite possibilities of *"exo-regions"* which are not even 
      defined yet!

            /That is... Until your Muses Inspire you to/
                       /Define a NEW Exotic "exo-region"!/

      Regions are Different than Worlds because they are defined by
      consensus of some governing body or artificial principal...
      Worlds simply "exist" without the influence of any outside 
      artificial constraints... Worlds are "nebulous" creatures!

   - *This Region Business Can Be Tricky:* 

      =A Region Can Exist Such As:= *The French Quarter of New Orleans* 
      which exists inside a *city* located within *yet another defined* 
      *region* called: *"South LA Delta Region"* which could also be called 
      part of the *"Deep South Region"* etc. etc. etc...

      OK... =How About a Region Defined by a Street Intersection?=
      *Times Square* region of *NYC*, /(which is a city but also a region/
      /containing many regions which also contain regions)/...

      If you are a Sci-Fi author the concept of a Location and/or region
      can become even more convoluted... Interdimensional regions may
      exist in fractal permutations all of them suspended in flux within
      the space of a single but fancy space ship...  A space ship which 
      also travels through multidimensional regions of space at the same
      time in parallel with other instances of itself... =OMG!=

      =And For-that-matter...= 

      Worlds, Regions, Locations, Planets, Satellites, COULD 
      ALL contain One or MORE New Worlds within them!

      /(If you write Sci-Fi, the possibilities are mind boggling!)/

      However, you may be inspired to create a smaller Region

   Celts and Gauls and more. Very few people bother to 
   look at this aspect of world-building, and they 
   really should. Even if a civilization has been 
   around for two thousand years and are elven dragon 
   riders, they came from somewhere. Even if their 
   mythology says they crawled out of the earth: they 
   came from somewhere. Examine it here in this space!
