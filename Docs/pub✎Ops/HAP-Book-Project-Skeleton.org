* 💡 Ideas Scratchpad Refile:
** ☞ Start Here!

:README:
Use this *Ideas / Scratchpad / Refile section as a quick place to document ideas and inspirations as they come alone.  You can refile them later... (even if it is intended for elsewhere) Parallel universe? Sure... You got that covered. %^)

- Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment ideas While they are still fresh in mind...

  + Come directly here... 

  + Advance your cursor a few newlines below this README drawer on a fresh clean line with some extra space below it as well... (above any previously time stamped entries you may already have placed)... (get rid of the "Visisonar - Object" Example Entry below... That is only for the template to illustrate these instructions by example...  

  + You are now at the top of the list and the time is the present...  There won't be any future entries ahead of you... (maybe next decade? time travel?)

  + Enter a new timestamp with "C-c .", Hit enter to auto accept today's date and time.

  + Give it a quick title and make this new line an outline heading at the proper level. 

  + Advance your cursor two lines below your new heading and begin typing away before you forget your fantastic idea!!!

  + You can organize everything else later...  Don't scare away the muses! Get your story down now!

  + Then you may go out to play elsewhere little grasshopper... But come back later and organize things... OK? Don't create a swamp in here! And don't forget to take your bath tonight... ;-) 

  + Having done the simple steps above any time you get inspired, you will be able to tell your grand children.. "I got my first spark of an idea for that book back in Year, Month, Day, time, second" (50 years later!) Now that is being organized! LOL

*** <2020-06-07 Sun> Visisonar - Object from Asimov's Foundation Series

:README:
This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... you might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

Later when you are free you can come back to file this or place it where it belongs.  In the case of the note below it would probably go in a research folder of a Sci-Fi related project...
:END:

From Isaac Asimov's science fiction series 'Foundation', specifically the section of 'Foundation and Empire' entitled 'The Mule', the visisonar is considered a musical instrument.

Unlike most instruments, this one does not achieve its effect by using sonic effects but, instead, directly stimulates the listeners' mental well-being. The number of people and level of effect depends on the skill level of the player. As this was a device from the First Empire, there were not that many people around with any skill at all. However, the Mule's clown, Magnifico, had some skill with the instrument and was asked to play for select parties on the Foundation and for large groups of workers on Haven. This may not have been a good idea...

This section provides skeleton templates to use to start real sections within your book.  Any sub heading under this *Templates:* group can be utilized by copy-pasting it anywhere you need to create a new section based on its structure... 

Or... You could try mashing several cloned templates together to create a totally new project with a different structure... The intent of this is to save lots of time Starting up a new writing project.  Lets see if it helps. :trollface:

Instructions:
   - Choose one of the templates below and copy it (folded).  Paste the copied template as a new clone within your project's book, planning, or research section...  Change the name of the template to its specific element name needed within your project's story-structure...

This serves as a replacement for my Scrivener planning Logs /(Currently implemented as markdown files outside of Scrivener)/... Each Org-based Writing project will have one or more of these logs right inside of it close to the things the logs are actually about...  No more fumbling and guessing which log was I useing for what? Now, not only can I find them, I can make them into tasks, TODOS, and prioritize them to boot! Consider this my new official general template for logs going forward... Onward we row mates... Over the log jam!

Take an hour and write a one-sentence summary of your novel. Something like this: 

"A rogue physicist travels back in time to kill the apostle Paul." 

The sentence will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This is the big picture, the analog of that big starting triangle in the snowflake picture.

When you later write your book proposal, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It's the hook that will sell your book to your editor, to your committee, to the sales force, to bookstore owners, and ultimately to readers. So make the best one you can!

Some hints on what makes a good sentence:

- Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.

- No character names, please! Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".

- Tie together the big picture and the personal picture. Which character has the most to lose in this story? Now tell me what he or she wants to win.

- Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list to learn how to do this. Writing a one-sentence description is an art form.

:README:
*Step 2:* Take another hour and expand that sentence to a full paragraph describing the story setup, major disasters, and ending of the novel. This is the analog of the second stage of the snowflake. 

I like to structure a story as "three disasters plus an ending". Each of the disasters takes a quarter of the book to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. I don't know if this is the ideal structure, it's just my personal taste.

If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then:

- The first disaster corresponds to the end of Act 1.

- The second disaster is the mid-point of Act 2. 

- The third disaster is the end of Act 2, and forces Act 3 which wraps things up. 

It is OK if the first disaster is caused by external circumstances, but I think that the second and third disasters should be caused by the protagonist's attempts to "fix things". Things just get worse and worse.

You can also use this paragraph in your proposal. Ideally, your paragraph will have about five sentences. One sentence to give you the backdrop and story setup. Then one sentence each for your three disasters. Then one more sentence to tell the ending. 

If this sounds suspiciously like back-cover copy, it's because . . . that's what it is and that's where it's going to appear someday.

:README:
Take several hours and expand each sentence of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster. The final paragraph should tell how the book ends.

Step 4) By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your novel, and you have only spent a day or two. Well, truthfully, you may have spent as much as a week, but it doesn't matter. If the story is broken, you know it now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft. So now just keep growing the story. Take several hours and expand each sentence of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster. The final paragraph should tell how the book ends.

This is a lot of fun, and at the end of the exercise, you have a pretty decent one-page skeleton of your novel. It's okay if you can't get it all onto one single-spaced page. What matters is that you are growing the ideas that will go into your story. You are expanding the conflict. You should now have a synopsis suitable for a proposal, although there is a better alternative for proposals . . .

**** 📃 Summary:

:README:
This section is the executive summary (abstract) of a longer full story chapter within your book.  Stories like the Finnegan Series are fully invested on not one but many Interstellar Nations!  Your mileage may vary... %^)

You need to incorporate all the results of your research here in a similar way that Isaac Asimov wrote chapters undergoing many iterations over time about the Galactic Empire in his Foundation Series... 

This abstract, is a short historical and present summary only... It should include the major goals, motivations... who they’re at war with, etc. i.e., It should include the news headlines, and ledelines...  but not the full story... Results of your research below this summary should be as rich and detailed as you can make it... (but also indexed!)

I learned about this Snowflake Idea several years ago when I was first learning how to use the structure to build my Scrivener Projects starting out on a Macbook Pro 2011 model... 

# This Emacs Org Mode based Book Publishing project has been initially modelled upon my Scrivener Project but it will soon outgrow more and do much more than Scrivener could ever dream of!  I am sure of it! I have already discovered much. The Learning curve is levelling off finally!  Writing this now in my fancy Emacs buffer specifically designed for distraction free writing mode is a dream! All my edits are made very close to the typewriter home row!  No reaching for any mice or hard to reach keys while the stream of consciousness flows!  Much of that typing ease is thanks to the detailed and structured eLisp programming work of Xah Lee!  OMG! You did a ton of great things!  No Troll in my book! You are the Knight in Armour for the weak of tendons! Fantastic! Thanks Dude!

:README:
I am still working out how to set up my drama script template...  I am using fountain mode to create audio dramas with sound and music cues etc.  This is semi automated using Afterwriting python script.  I edit all the files in Emacs but it is easier to run the build script on the command line.  The build script creates a new PDF file.

I have plans to create all that automation within Org-Mode and that is what this template should be about... The fountain files could also be created programmatically here from their project folder... There would be some way to click on a link to the script, *(a .fountain file) and then it would automatically open up in another frame of the proper dimensions for editing a screenplay in Modular Emacs...
