* Default Tags:                                                    :noexport:
** Instructions:

This file is included as part of *Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs* to provide an example of how ~org-tags~ are organized by default once *Modular Emacs* is installed on your machine...

=Usage:= *COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory
        to the MASTER directory where existing .org files reference
        this contained default-tags SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP
        Files within your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

        =Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

  =Add:= the following line to the Header of ~.Org~ Files that need to
        include this file:

        ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~

/Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ /master/
/folder To your book's project directory will allow you to make your own custom/
/configurations for different books without affecting the configurations of other/
/book projects within their own MASTER FOLDERS.../

- *Modify your Copy/Clone:* of this file to create new ~<your_category>-tags.org~ files of your own design...

- *Use the Global Defined Tag Keys selection keys listed below* when creating new tags for your custom tags file...  Replace Local Defined Tags below with your changed tags selection characters. (for quick tagging)...

- *You could use a custom SETUPFILE in addition to this default setupfile*. In that case, consider ALL of the keys below, (global & local) to be already used. If you wish to have speed keys for your new custom tags, they will have to be unique /(different from the keys defined below)/...  

** Defined Tag Keys:

/(These are from above local file settings, as well as global ones set by HA Mod Emacs Org Mode Module: ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~)/

- *Globall:* /a b c d e f l n o p q r s t x A G H I L N R T V W 0 1 2 5 + - ?/

- *Local:* /g h i k m u v w y ; ! # $ % 3 4 9 =/
