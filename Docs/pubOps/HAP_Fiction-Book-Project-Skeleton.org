☞ =Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/

To use *HAP_Fiction-BOok-Project-Skeleton.org* /(Org-Mode Fiction Book Project /Template)/ for your own projects, perform the following steps: 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *Clone a Copy of This File:* 

      Put your clone where you normally organize your writing 
      projects. *Place it within its own master folder... It is*
      *Important to keep this file within its OWN enclosing folder!* 

      Name the project's master folder to reflect your fiction book 
      project's title... /(what you renamed this .org file to)/...

      =Other Files/Folders will be placed within this master folder...=

2) [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./media~ /(and contents)/ *to your new project's Master Folder:*

      Copy this directory /(into your master folder as a sibling of this file).../ 
      Any external documents or images referenced by your book project should 
      be placed within this ~./media/~ directory...

      All external links, images, within the boilerplate examples of this
      template may be used as examples for getting your own images, and 
      external attachments linked properly...  

      This single ~./media~ directory will serve media and external attachments 
      for all of the ~.org~ doc template files from within: ~.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps~ 
      directory /(if they were also copied here to your Project's Master Folder)/

   =Note:=  You DON'T need to copy the ~./auto/~ directory...  That directory
           will be automatically created the first time you export this ~.org~ 
           file to ~.PDF~...

3) [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./org-templates~ /(and all contents)/ *to your Master Folder:*

      Copy this directory to your Book Project's Master Folder, /(as a sibling/
      /of this .org file).../ 

      =Note:= The SETUPFILES Within this directory which are called out and 
             included by this .org file /(above)/ must stay within this 
             directory...  

             Other SETUPFILES within this directory are used by other book 
             project templates and are not needed for this Fiction Book 
             Project... You may remove them if you wish... They are small
             text files not bothering you... If you clone another 
             ~HAP_<book-template>.org~ file into this project folder it will 
             pick up its associated SETUPFILES automatically, so consider 
             that if/when you decide to delete other UNUSED SETUPFILES...

4) [ ] =Start Sketching Out Your Story NOW Before You Loose It!=

      =NOTE:= You may be doing this because you have some fantastic story idea
             brewing in your mind and you need to write that down before you 
             forget!  =Right?=  Therefore... as soon as you are done with the
             first steps above, =STOP= and go immediately to the:

                   ~💡 Ideas Scratchpad Refile / ☞ Start Here!~ 

             section and read the ~:README:~ directly under that heading...  
             Then write your idea down quickly /(as per the README instructions)/ 
             to get your inspiration recorded before you forget it...  

             Later, After you have all your ideas sketched out and you are 
             ready to be in an ="organized mood"= /(rather than creative mood)/ 
             /This does not imply being organized cannot be a CREATIVE PROCESS/ 
             Then it is time to:

             =Come Back Here And Finish Setting Up Your Project...=

             *This Project Template is HUGE!*

             *Your Muse Can Easily Loose Her Inspiration!*

             =The ☞ Start Here Section is Your Remedy= 

             =Do That first!=

5) [ ] *Finish Setting up this Project LATER...* [0/3]

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your Fiction Book Project's Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Change to: /"your-Fiction-Book-Project's-Title.pdf"/
          This will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
          /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Compose /Your-Fiction-Book-Project's Description/ as a short 
          paragraph here...

    - *The* ~./media~ *Directory is ALL Set:* 

         Any external documents or images referenced by your book project 
         should be placed within this ~./media/~ directory... This single 
         ~./media~ directory will serve media and external attachments for this 
         and any other fiction related ~.org~ files you may end up creating 
         here, as well as being the media repository used by LaTeX during 
         publishing...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./auto/~ *Directory:* /(you do not need to copy this)/

         This is or will-be an auto generated folder where your output ~.PDF~ 
         files are created and placed during LaTeX export. You DO NOT need 
         to copy this folder as it is auto generated during org-mode LaTeX 
         processing...

         LaTeX processing will not delete any prior files contained here... 
         Some of them will be updated, but will have backups...  Any files 
         you place within this folder will NOT be lost, unless you delete 
         them... This folder is a good place to store other temporary files 
         you may be creating, generating.. etc...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

         The files in here are automatically linked and included within this
         template. You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to
         customize the already customized tags, and export options.

         /They are allready set up correctly for the fiction book genre, and the category is all set as well... But you can and may modify the original files to fit your needs.../

6) [ ] =Ongoing Planning / Writing Your Fiction Book:= 

      /Change headings and structure to match your project's outline/ 
      /sections-chapters-scenes-plots-characters, etc.../

      *Start doing the Tasks within the Tasks section:*

      =Have fun doing this...=

7) [ ] =Export/Publish to PDF File:=

      The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the SETUPFILES above will 
      get this file looking good when exported as a Standard PDF file.  
      Once you have your project directory all set up as above you are 
      ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

         *Issue the following Emacs command:*

            ~M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf~

         *OR* If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys* /"Command Mode"/ Try Shortcut:

            ~SPACE e p~

         *OR Export to OTHER Formats:*

            ~C-c C-e~

            /(a pop-up will show allowing you to choose export method)/

      After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., a new *PDF* by the name of: ~HAP_Untitled-Fiction-Book.pdf~ -and- ~HAP_Untitled-Fiction-Book.tex~ 
      will appear within the same directory as this file...

      Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your existing ~HAP_Untitled-Fiction-Book.pdf~ -and- ~HAP_Untitled-Fiction-Book.tex~ 
      files! /(make backups first if needed!)/
      You should probably copy these files to the ~./auto/~ directory as 
      well for safe keeping as backups...

      =If you chose the last option above= LaTeX will output files with other
      extensions for those other output formats... =NOTE:= SETUPFILES have not
      been created yet for other eBook formats.  /(This is a work in progress)/

      =If YOU EXPERIENCE LaTeX ERRORS:= 

         *Consult Buffer:* ~*Org PDF LaTeX Output*~

=These Instructions Were Last Modified:= <2022-09-09 Fri> 

So far things are pretty basic PDF... We will get fancy with other formats later... 
I promice... I have to do all this documentation first!
/(As you can see, if you been following for the past couple years, things are/ 
 /getting done! Albeit Slowly)/

=Please Open an ISSUE At:= https://github.com/harmonicalchemy/modular-emacs/issues
   
Please use Issues to Ask Questions, Report Problems/Bugs etc., and Suggest Ideas for Improvement... =You guys are my Product Managers=  I am only a User of ONE "seat".

* 💡 Scratchpad Refile:      :noexport:
** ☞ Start Here!
:README:
   This Section is mainly to accommodate "seat-of-pants" writers
          /(Of Which I Have Been Accused Of.../
           /But I Also Crave The Planning Stuff)/. 

   I often come here for my [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html]["yak shaving"]] adventures...

   Use this: *💡 Scratchpad Refile* section as a quick place to 
   document ideas and inspirations as they come along... 
   You can refile them later... 

   Even if your quick inspiration was intended for elsewhere?,
   /(e.g., You become bored documenting tedious technical/ 
   /information when suddenly, out-of-nowhere, an idea for a/ 
   /new sci-fi scene in that screenplay episode you had in the/ 
   /back of your mind all day!, etc.)/

   =Ummm.... Parallel Universe?=

   =Sure!= You can put anything in here! We've got that covered 
         for you in this Start Here spot. %^)

   Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment 
   ideas =While they are still fresh in mind=

   =How To Use ???= 

      /Simply Come directly here and do what ever you want.../
      /"Your Crazy Daze are Covered!" Yay!/ 

   =The following Shortcuts= will Help you get started as 
   quickly as possible:

   - [ ] =Copy/Clone:= *💡* <2022-08-20 Sat> *Example Idea* =Below:=

         =Copy the Heading AND ALL ITS CONTENTS=

         /Change your Clone's Title to Your Own Title/

   - [ ] *Change the timestamp on your Clone Entry:* [0/1]

         =Type:= ~C-c .~ while cursor is sitting on the timestamp

         /i.e., Press: ~Ctrl-c~, let go, and then type a Period/ ~.~

         A date chooser panel will pop up...

     + [ ] *Press* ~ENTER~ *to auto accept today's date and time.*  

            The existing timestamp will change to TODAY...

   - [ ] *Advance your cursor and Start Writing!!!*

          Advance your cursor few more lines down to some fresh 
          empty space and Start Typing Your Story Idea Like Mad!!! 
          /(Remove the boilerplate content after reading it...)/

   - [ ] *Don't stop Writing!* 

          Don't worry about formatting or organizing it until later, 
          after all your inspiration has passed and you are ready 
          to organize...

   - [ ] =TODO After You Are Done Writing:=

        + [ ] *Adjust Space:* 

               Adjust space between your headings and your 
               fantastic ideas below them it to one single 
               blank line...

        + [ ] *Continue Writing/Developing RIGHT HERE if needed:*

               If you are not yet sure where this NEW IDEA should go
               AND you are still inspired to write... Simply continue
               writing and developing this IDEA in place RIGHT HERE...

               Don't Worry about what it is for or where to put it...
               It is still here in "dream state" which is GOOD...
               Don't scare away your muses when they beckon! 
               Get your story down first, no matter what state it 
               may be in... =GET IT DOWN=

        + [ ] *You Are Free To Go Out And Play Elsewhere Little Grasshopper*

               If after writing... You don't feel like organizing 
               now? =NO PROBLEM=... But come back later and organize 
               things... =OK?= Don't create a swamp in here! 
               /And don't forget to take/ /your bath tonight... ;-)/

   Having done the simple steps above any time you get inspired, you 
   will much later in life be able to tell your grand children.. 
   /"I got my first spark of an idea for that story back in Year,/ 
   /Month, Day, time, second"/ 50 years later! Now that is being 
   organized! LOL

** NEW 💡 <2022-08-20 Sat> New Example Idea /(clone this)/
:README:
   This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have 
   gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something 
   elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as 
   much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back 
   to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... 
   You might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

   Later when you are free you can come back to file this or place it 
   where it belongs.  In the case of the note below it would probably 
   go in a research folder of a Sci-Fi related project...

** NEW 💡 <2020-06-07 Sun> Visisonar Object /(from Asimov's Foundation Series)/
:README:
   This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... you might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

:END:

From Isaac Asimov's science fiction series 'Foundation', specifically the section of 'Foundation and Empire' entitled 'The Mule', the visisonar is considered a musical instrument.

Unlike most instruments, this one does not achieve its effect by using sonic effects but, instead, directly stimulates the listeners' mental well-being. The number of people and level of effect depends on the skill level of the player. As this was a device from the First Empire, there were not that many people around with any skill at all. However, the Mule's clown, Magnifico, had some skill with the instrument and was asked to play for select parties on the Foundation and for large groups of workers on Haven. This may not have been a good idea...

*** 📒 Back Stories: /(Chapter Template)/                            :noexport:
:README:
   This section is for a chapter's Back Story development... 
   The following tips will help you manage development of your 
   back stories and how they will best fit into your 
   evolving story... 

   - =Keep Things Organized:=

      + *Add Time Stamped Background Notes:* /(within the Background/ 
          /Notes section above)/ about new content added to this 
          Back Stories section as you progress over time...

      + *Add Time Stamps to:* Sub-headings within the Background 
          Notes Section that reflect back to paragraphs written 
          within this section...

      + *Add TODO Keywords* to sub-headings within the Background 
          Notes Section reflecting back to paragraphs written 
          within this section...

   Doing the above steps will help you keep track of back story 
   development and get better organized about how your book is 
   developing, what areas need the most work, seeing problems that 
   need to be resolved, etc.  Most importantly, this will help 
   prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing contradictions 
   within your story later... /(unless that was your intention/ 
   /"Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case you will be better informed 
   by keeping things organized here where you can see them and 
   resolve them quickly...

   =The Content Written Within This Section May or May Not be= 
   =Added to actual Chapters/Scenes of your Book...=
:END:
**** 📒 Back Story: <2020-05-10 Sun> /(Example)/

=Note:= This is an example of a back story related to this 
      chapter, or possibly connecting to another chapter 
      in your book... 

      Write it down in the rough here and then later you 
      can develop it further as needed. Keep Background 
      Notes about this back story as well, AND keep them 
      up to date as this story develops!

   Not Intended to be Added back to the Chapters/Scenes of your 
   Book... The purpose of Plot Summaries are to help you during 
   planning stages where you are trying to resolve that twisty 
   mess you created... OMG!

   Keeping the above in mind while writing the plot summary of a 
   chapter, will help you get better organized about how your book 
   is developing, what directions it is taking, what areas need the 
   most work, where problems or inconsistencies may arise, etc.  

   Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave 
   mistakes causing contradictions within your story later... 
   /(unless that was your intention "Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case 
   you will be better informed by keeping all your plot tasks here 
   where you can see them and resolve them quickly...

In this chapter we are dealing with yadda yadda yadda which must be resolved with yadda yadda yadda.  But be careful about Yadda Yadda Yadda as she does not exist in this book at all!  What?  Nevermind... She never existed... Only in your dreams...

   =It is HIGHLY Recommended= for you to use the steps below FIRST 
   before doing any other writing!  This advise comes from many 
   highly acclaimed master authors! /(including Mark Twain himself!)/
:END:
*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Do This First: =Important=

=NOTE:= Before you start you need to answer the 
      following questions:

- [ ] *What is your main category or genera?*

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *You write within this genera because?*

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *Readers will be attracted to and enjoy your stories because?*

       _______________________________________


After completing above, follow the steps below...

\newpage

*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Step One - Write a Single Sentence Summary:

=Take An Hour And Write A One-Sentence Summary Of Your Novel:= 
   
*Something like this:*

   /"A gourmet chef from Boston acedentally falls into a parallel/ 
    /world, almost destroyed by an arch enemy he did not even know/ 
    /he had, then he discovers he is immortal and meets-re-discovers/ 
    /his ancient soul mate of eons. Together they save the universe/ 
    /after all else fails!"/

OK I know... I cheated. The second sentence is a stinger. It needs to stand alone... I often buck the rules... lol

The sentence you end up writing above will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This exercise defines the big picture illustrated by the first simple triangle in the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and/ /classmates by Baby Bear in: Chapter 4 of Randy Ingermanson's Book:/ 
/"How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

Within that same chapter, Baby Bear also pointed out this important fact to keep in mind: 

   /(Illustrated "Radio Drama" Style Just For Fun, Because We Can... ;-)/

This is important, you novelists!
   
You're going to get lots of advice on how to write a novel.  
    
But that's all it is. Advice. If you don't like that advice, 
    
if it doesn't work for you, then ignore it.  
    
If it does work for you, then run with it.

#+END_SRC

I agree... Don't let anybody steer you away from your muses! But at the same time don't ignore the basics!

This synopsis stuff is basic to the bone! It is universal... We cannot buck it!  It's based on human nature... Your sentence above, will serve as a pitch during normal conversations /(to see if there is any interest)/...

=Memorize "your line"= to the point that you can say it in your sleep! Turn it into a "slogan" /(hopefully a "meme" if you are the lucky type)/. Your goal is that others will remember and be able to easily tell all their friends /(word/ /for word)/. Networking is the key! You can't do it alone... Songs are also great help! /(cartoons and songs are killer!)/ Social networks open you up to sky limit possibilities!

=Lead with your story line while engaging with a total stranger= or even your mother. =Remain silent after that=... Wait to see if there is interest before diving deeper... That and your good body language "posture" will take care of everything...

=Important!= Closing rules of sales dictate the law of attraction 
           always applies.. Pushing yields negative results... 
           =If you push people... They push back...= 

           =If you run away from people, they chase you...= 

           To eat, or to be eaten... That's what it all comes down to. 
           lol Wait to see if there is interest... 

           =If NOT, Move On...= 
           =If YES... Do The Next Step...=

When the time comes for you to write your book proposal, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It's the hook that will sell your book to your editor, to your committee, to the sales force, to bookstore owners, and ultimately to readers. So make the best one you can!

***** Here are some tips:

- *Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.*

- *No character names, please!* 

   Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".

- *Tie together the big picture and the personal picture.* 

   Which character has the most to lose in this story? 
   Now tell me what he or she wants to win.

- *Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list* 

   This will teach you how to do it by example. Writing a 
   one-sentence description is an art form. If you become a 
   master at this, marketing firms will want you madly!

- *Check out:* [[yt:feD-dImM4a8][LEGO Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 60 Seconds]] 

   /(and other 60 second movies like it)/ for a completely 
   different audio/visual parallel to this literary concept...

*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Two - Expand Summary to Paragraph

=Take another hour and expand your sentence= from step one into a full paragraph describing the story setup, major disasters, and ending of the novel.

This step defines the second stage of the snowflake model... as illustrated by further trisections of the triangle producing the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and classmates by Baby Bear in chapter 5, "The Importance of being Disastrous" in Randy Ingermanson's book: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

For this step, *visualize the story as having "three disasters plus an ending"* 

Each of the disasters takes a quarter of the book to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. 

No one claims this to be an absolute ideal structure, but it's the one that Randy Ingermanson uses, and it has a strong basis in psychology.

=If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then:=

- *The first disaster would correspond to the end of Act 1*

- *The second disaster would be the mid-point of Act 2*

- *The third disaster would come at the end of Act 2, and force Act 3*

- *Act 3 wraps everything up*

\newpage

**** Make 5 Sentences: [0/5]

1. [ ] =Exposition:=

   This sentence's purpose is to paint the story setting, 
   backdrop and mention leading characters within a 
   descriptive role... The mood is set here briefly, 
   dripping with consentrated visions of expectation!

2. [ ] =Act One:= - *First Disaster Summary*

   The first disaster emerges out of circumstance. 
   This is the key event that motivates our lead character 
   /(hero)/ to find a remedy.  This disaster must hit home to 
   our readers as well, inspiring them along side our hero 
   as faithful evangelists... 

3. [ ] =First Half of Act Two:= - *Second Disaster Summary*

   The second disaster is the result of our budding hero's 
   attempt to "fix things" after the first disaster in Act One. 
   But things keep getting worse, not better.  As a result, 
   our hero experiences an epiphany, realizing the errors of 
   her ways, and resolves to do things the correct way from 
   that moment on... /(the music changes, new hope emerges)/

4. [ ] =Second Half of Act Two:= - *Third Disaster & Standoff Summary*

   The last half of Act 2 is the standoff between your hero 
   and villain or obstacle... Here is where your hero's new 
   resolve to doing the right thing begins to pay off.  
   However this act ends with the third disaster...  
   Act 3 will determine the final outcome.

5. [ ] =Act 3 Summary:= *(conclusion)*

   This is where it all previous conflicts are finally resolved, 
   one way or the other... Whether or not the lead character 
   /(hero)/ whatever succeeds or fails.  The story once resolved 
   ends as a comedy, tragedy, or mellowdrama...
   You decide on that...

\newpage

**** Using Your One-Paragraph Summary:

You will be using this paragraph in your proposals. It is only for your agents etc.  Not for your readers who need to be kept in the dark about how the story develops before reading the book! =Watch Out Spoilers!=

=However=, Some of this paragraph /(written with parts pourposefully left out or with questions put in place)/ may end up back-cover copy for your book's promotion.

\newpage

*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Three - Expand Paragraph to Synopsis:

=Take several hours to expand each sentence= of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. 

*All but the last paragraph should end in a disaster.* The final paragraph is the final conclusion to those disasters bringing your book to a close.

You can employ the snowflake method at finer levels here... Breaking each paragraph into mini disasters or turning points within the main disaster, etc.

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your novel, and you have only spent a day or two, or at most, a week or two, but all that time will not have been wasted! You will now have a good idea if there are problems with your story. This is good knowledge to have now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft.

At the end of this exercise, you will have a nice one-page skeleton of your novel. It's fine if your skeleton does not fit all on one single-spaced page as long as it does not go beyond that... 

Your process now is to grow these ideas as chapters of your story. You are expanding the conflict. You have a synopsis suitable for a proposal, and you are well on your way to doing extended promotion...

\newpage

*** NEW <2022-08-25 Thu> Completion:

- [ ] *Copy one-page skeleton from:* =Step Three= above to: *📃 Synopsis:* 
       inside the *🕮 Book:* Binder...

       when you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have 
       completed half the battle of writing your novel! The other 
       half is getting to know your characters... Plots and chapters 
       will flow from that effortlessly...

          Use Command: ~C-c . RET~ while cursor is on the 
          timestamp to update it to the current date/time...

          This is all to aid you while you are working on a
          new character... Once your character is reasonably
          set up... Reset all the TODO States to ~NEW~ for the
          next character you will be doing this for...

          You can also mark the TODO states of any of the 
          headings within your final Character Profile as
          you are working on them there...

   Some of these Character tasks are based on the Snowflake Method 
   as outlined in Randy Ingermanson's book:

         [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/articles/snowflake-method/]["How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"]]

   Other tasks are based on concepts outlined within the book:

   how... Only dry forms have been included here to make it convenient 
   for you to complete this process...  

   =You are strongly encouraged= to purchase and read the above two 
   books so that you will have a deeper understanding while you 
   work through this process...

   The tasks within this section will be used to produce a

   The Character Bible in turn will be used to create your
   character's Official Profile & Synopsis... /(which is a/ 
   /more formal and condensed presentation Binder without/ 
   /all the worksheets, interviews, and details...)/

   =A character bible is the private lifetime personell file= of a
   character...  It will hold scrapbook like items of importance 
   throughout the character's life...  

   There's a TV show on Amazon called: *"Hanna"* where this concept 
   has been illustrated perfectly! In this CIA black ops thriller, 
   Babies DNA are enhanced with wolf genes to make them grow up into 
   super soldiers... When these children get deployed 
   /(looking as normal youths/ /in high school)/, they are each assigned
   a scrap-book containing all of their *"character's"* vital details.  
   There are pictures of family, best friends, past events, etc.  
   Their photo is on the front cover...

   =All of it is fake...=, BUT as these secret CIA teens carry out 
   roll play /(within their fake role as normal high school students)/, 
   soon... they begin to believe more and more that they actually 
   "are" who their scrapbook profiles say they are and not trained

** 📄 About:

This =Meta= section provides skeleton templates for use within your project(s).  Any sub heading under this Meta: group can be utilized by copy-pasting the collapsed heading into any of your existing project sections (i.e., making a clone anywhere you need to create a new section based on the template's structure)... 

Or... You could try mashing several cloned templates together to create a totally new project heading with a totally different structure... The intent of this is to save lots of time starting up a new custom writing project.  Lets see if it helps. :trollface:

*** 📒 Back Stories: /(Chapter Template)/
:README:
   This section is for a chapter's Back Story development... 
   The following tips will help you manage development of your 
   back stories and how they will best fit into your 
   evolving story... 

   - =Keep Things Organized:=

      + *Add Time Stamped Background Notes:* /(within the Background/ 
          /Notes section above)/ about new content added to this 
          Back Stories section as you progress over time...

      + *Add Time Stamps to:* Sub-headings within the Background 
          Notes Section that reflect back to paragraphs written 
          within this section...

      + *Add TODO Keywords* to sub-headings within the Background 
          Notes Section reflecting back to paragraphs written 
          within this section...

   Doing the above steps will help you keep track of back story 
   development and get better organized about how your book is 
   developing, what areas need the most work, seeing problems that 
   need to be resolved, etc.  Most importantly, this will help 
   prevent you from making any grave mistakes causing contradictions 
   within your story later... /(unless that was your intention/ 
   /"Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case you will be better informed 
   by keeping things organized here where you can see them and 
   resolve them quickly...

   =The Content Written Within This Section May or May Not be= 
   =Added to actual Chapters/Scenes of your Book...=
:END:
**** 📒 Back Story: <2020-05-10 Sun> /(Example)/

=Note:= This is an example of a back story related to this 
      chapter, or possibly connecting to another chapter 
      in your book... 

      Write it down in the rough here and then later you 
      can develop it further as needed. Keep Background 
      Notes about this back story as well, AND keep them 
      up to date as this story develops!

\newpage

*** 🗡 Plot Summary: /(Chapter Template)/
:README:
   Plot Summaries, /(Just Like Background Notes)/ are ALSO =META DATA= 
   Not Intended to be Added back to the Chapters/Scenes of your 
   Book... The purpose of Plot Summaries are to help you during 
   planning stages where you are trying to resolve that twisty 
   mess you created... OMG!

   Keeping the above in mind while writing the plot summary of a 
   chapter, will help you get better organized about how your book 
   is developing, what directions it is taking, what areas need the 
   most work, where problems or inconsistencies may arise, etc.  

   Most importantly, this will help prevent you from making any grave 
   mistakes causing contradictions within your story later... 
   /(unless that was your intention "Alfred Hitchcock")/... In any case 
   you will be better informed by keeping all your plot tasks here 
   where you can see them and resolve them quickly...
:END:

=Plot Summary= /(example)/

In this chapter we are dealing with yadda yadda yadda which must be resolved with yadda yadda yadda.  But be careful about Yadda Yadda Yadda as she does not exist in this book at all!  What?  Nevermind... She never existed... Only in your dreams...

*** NEW 🗓 LOG: <2021-03-29 Mon> Entry /(Log Entry Template)/
:README:
   - *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:* /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

      =Punch the Time Clock= At the heading And then begin working on a
      task related to that Heading... =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= 

   - =Use These Commands:= /as you work to keep track your time.../

      + *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ 

           /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

           This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
           underneath the HEADING...

           Do this just before starting work on the task... 
           Be in control of your life!

           After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
           work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
           other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
           be recording your time all the while... You will see 
           in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
           as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
           and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

           /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

           You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
           while and you need to come back to update the item's
           info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
           do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

           This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
           ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the/ /clock)/

           The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end 
           timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

           =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e.,
           Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse,
           leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it
           again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do/
           /you want to do with this?"/ If you do something like 
           that you can always come back and directly edit the 
           clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing 
           clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

           ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

           This command will change the total time at the end showing 
           your new calculated time...

           If you need to go away and do something else before finishing 
           this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come 
           back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card 
           Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear 
           above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When 
           you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry 
           below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

           When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
           command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
           /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
           /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
           So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
           marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
           /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
           /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

           This removes currently running clock and forgets 
           any time accrued or associated with it...

      + ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:*

           /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
           =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
           within your org file with those timestamps!!!

   =Note:= Once all of the above commands become routine for you, you 
          might want to remove this ~:README:~ drawer from this 
          template... That way it won't get copied when you need to

   This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content, then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what you were looking for... 

   Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

   Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...

***** NEW <2022-08-26 Fri> 👤 Detailed Character Interview:

- [ ] *Perform a Detailed Character Interview:*  

       This is best done as a "role play" exercise where you 
       become "the character" who is having an interview with 
       a doctor, or lawyer, or someone qualified to keep secrets 
       confidential etc. Some of the information below would be 
       provided via written examination... Other things would be 
       done face to face... You will know the context when you 
       get to those points...

       Doing it this way will put you in the right emotional 
       framework. You will adopt this character's normal anxiety,  
       expectations, assumptions, prejustice etc. You will end up 
       feeling this character's impressions of the various questions 
       on the forms, and you will feel this persons emotions and  
       expectations going into a face to face interview... The 
       results will be more authentic about the character and less, 
       if anything at all about you the author...

- [ ] *Transfer Some Results of below to 💬 Profile:*

       Some of the information collected under the Headings 
       below will be placed under headings within this New 
       Character's *💬 Profile:* Binder... They are not in the
       same order and may not be titled the same either...

*** NEW ♾ New World: /(Master Template)/
:README:
   - *DEFINITION:*

      =From Wikipedia:= "In its most general sense, the term "world" refers 
      to the totality of entities, to the whole of reality or to everything 
      that is. The nature of the world has been conceptualized differently 
      in different fields."

      *For Our Purposes as Fiction Authors:* Our Definition shall be a
      *"plurality of worlds"* Worlds which are Still =ALL encompassing BUT=
      =Not Encompassing ALL= so-to-speak...

      Worlds are Different than Regions because Worlds simply "exist" 
      without the influence of any outside artificial influence... 
      Worlds can be quite "nebulous" ♾ creatures! Regions are based on 
      defined formalized constraints...

   - *World Creation Can be Tricky:*

      If you fall into a black rabbit hole through the centre of the earth,
      /(Like Alice).../ What happens when you come out the other side?  
      Will everyone in China be upside down?

      Expanding on the confusing =ALL Encompassing= statement from our 
      *World* definition above, The following ideas are assumed for:
      *New Worlds Created Here:*

      =A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not Contain One-Or-Many= *Locations/Regions* 

      =A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not Contain One-Or-Many= *Planets or Satellites*

      =A= *♾ New World* =May Be Something OTHER than:= *Planet or Satellite*

      =A= *♾ New World* =May-Or-May-Not be BASED on= *Classical Euclidean Space*

      =A= *♾ New World* =May CONTAIN or BE CONTAINED by OTHER WORLDS or THINGS!!!=

      =And For-that-matter...= 

      Worlds, Regions, Locations, Planets, Satellites, COULD 
      ALL contain One or MORE New Worlds within them!

      *New Worlds Containing Guess what?*

      =OMG Girl! Do The Math! %^)=

      /(If you write Sci-Fi, the possibilities are mind boggling!)/

      /"Eat just a wee bit of the proper side of that mushroom and you/ 
       /will be too big to be a dog's meal but small enough to follow/
       /the rabbit through/ /that small door..."/

      =For Most Cases= *♾ New World:* Items will be created in conjunction 
      with corresponding Regions, Planets, Groups, etc... /(no matter what/
      /their hierarchical relationship may be...)/

   - [ ] *USAGE:* [0/4]

      For most common cases, you will need to create a New World as 
      a container for any defined Regions, Planets, Groups, etc., 
      Which... in turn were created because they are the reference 
      source for elements within your evolving story (book)...

      However, you may be inspired to create much more interesting Worlds
      /(all by themselves unique jewels)/ that end up becoming Bizarr Cases 
      that Do NOT Contain any of the classical kinds of things you might 
      find normally within Euclidean space, depending on the nature of 
      your story...

*** NEW ✨ New Region: /(Master Template)/
:README:
   - *DEFINITION:*

      A Region Is Defined As: An "area" or "space" which is broadly 
      divided by physical characteristics /(physical geography)/, any 
      impact characteristics of inhabitants /(bio geography)/, and the 
      interaction of inhabitants with the area's environment 
      /(environmental geography)/. 

      The word *"region"* is taken from the Latin *regio* /(derived from/ 
      /regere, 'to rule')/ In mathematics the term: *"domain"* is a similar 
      concept to the generalized idea of *"regions"* as defined within 
      various geographical sciences: /(e.g., physical geography, ecology,/ 
      /biogeography, zoogeography, environmental geography, ethnography,/ 
      /etc.)/ And of course all of the *Exo-* versions of these as well...

      Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their 
      imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except 
      in the case where some governing body has defined artificial borders.

      Apart from geographic regions, there are also hydrospheric and 
      atmospheric regions. /(e.g., oceans, lakes, rivers, discrete/ 
      /climates of elevations above sea level)/... Add to this the 
      infinite possibilities of *"exo-regions"* which are not even 
      defined yet!

            /That is... Until your Muses Inspire you to/
                       /Define a NEW Exotic "exo-region"!/

      Regions are Different than Worlds because they are defined by
      consensus of some governing body or artificial principal...
      Worlds simply "exist" without the influence of any outside 
      artificial constraints... Worlds are "nebulous" creatures!

   - *This Region Business Can Be Tricky:* 

      =A Region Can Exist Such As:= *The French Quarter of New Orleans* 
      which exists inside a *city* located within *yet another defined* 
      *region* called: *"South LA Delta Region"* which could also be called 
      part of the *"Deep South Region"* etc. etc. etc...

      OK... =How About a Region Defined by a Street Intersection?=
      *Times Square* region of *NYC*, /(which is a city but also a region/
      /containing many regions which also contain regions)/...

      If you are a Sci-Fi author the concept of a Location and/or region
      can become even more convoluted... Interdimensional regions may
      exist in fractal permutations all of them suspended in flux within
      the space of a single but fancy space ship...  A space ship which 
      also travels through multidimensional regions of space at the same
      time in parallel with other instances of itself... =OMG!=

      =And For-that-matter...= 

      Worlds, Regions, Locations, Planets, Satellites, COULD 
      ALL contain One or MORE New Worlds within them!

      /(If you write Sci-Fi, the possibilities are mind boggling!)/

      =For Most Cases:= Any *✨ New Region:* Items defined will have 
      corresponding and related Items defined somewhere in the 
      *🔍 Research:* Section as well...

   - [ ] *USAGE:* [0/4]

      For most common cases, you will need to create a New Region 
      as a container for a defined Planet, or Group, etc... 
      Which... in turn were created because they are the reference 
      source for elements within your evolving story (book)...

      However, you may be inspired to create a smaller Region 
      which may be contained within a special World, or localized 
      to a planet or other body in space, or even some small 
      microscopic region inside a single drop of water!  
      All of the above depending on the nature of your story...

      =Add:= As Many *✨ New Region:* Headings As Needed And Are

             /while you were off doing something completely different!/

   Celts and Gauls and more. Very few people bother to 
   look at this aspect of world-building, and they 
   really should. Even if a civilization has been 
   around for two thousand years and are elven dragon 
   riders, they came from somewhere. Even if their 
   mythology says they crawled out of the earth: they 
   came from somewhere. Examine it here in this space!

***** 📚 History
:README:
   =Everyone Comes From Somewhere...= People just don’t up and appear 
   on islands and such.  The Native Americans walked across a land 
   bridge way back in the day... Europeans came from Romans and 
   Greeks and Celts and Gauls and more... Very few people bother to 
   look at this aspect of world-building, and they really should.
   Even if a civilization has been around for two thousand years and 
   are Elven Dragon Riders, they came from somewhere.  Even if their 
   mythology says they crawled out of the earth: they came from somewhere.

***** 🕉 Language
:README:
   This is kind of a big one for me, because I’m always very careful 
   to point how and why my characters can understand each other, 
   especially if they are from different countries. Language in the 
   real world is a hell of a barrier, but even if you have a Chinese 
   dragon, an Arabian unicorn, a French knight, a Mayan princess, 
   and a Japanese ninja, they can all talk to and understand each 
   other without explanation. Double I-call-BS-points for someone 
   from another world or time!  Anyone who has ever toured Europe 
   can tell you why this is complete bull.  Take a closer look, 
   especially if you’re modeling anything after medieval Europe; 
   only the Church had a universal language: Latin.
