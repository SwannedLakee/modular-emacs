* Default Tags:                                                    :noexport:
** Instructions:

This file is included as part of *Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs* to provide an example of how ~org-tags~ are organized by default once *Modular Emacs* is installed on your machine...

- *Use this as your Default* ~SETUPFILE~ *for new documents*. /(it is already included in other .org file templates within this repository)/.

- *Copy/Clone* this file to create new ~<your_category>-tags.org~ files of your own design...

- *Use the Global Defined Tag Keys selection keys listed below* when creating new tags for your custom tags file...  Replace Local Defined Tags below with your changed tags selection characters. (for quick tagging)...

- *You could use a custom SETUPFILE in addition to this default setupfile*. In that case, consider ALL of the keys below, (global & local) to be already used. If you wish to have speed keys for your new custom tags, they will have to be unique /(different from the keys defined below)/...  

** Defined Tag Keys:

/(These are from above local file settings, as well as global ones set by HA Mod Emacs Org Mode Module: ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~)/

- *Globall:* /a b c d e f l n o p q r s t x A G H I L N R T V W 0 1 2 5 + - ?/

- *Local:* /g h i k m u v w y ; ! # $ % 3 4 9 =/
