=File:=  ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates/fiction-book-setup.org~
        =ORG-MODE LaTeX SETUPFILE for: FICTION Books=
        ~#+LATEX_CLASS: blueboxbook~

:README:

=Usage:= *Copy/Clone* this file and adjust to suit your needs...
       *Include* this file within ~.org~ files destined to become
       a *Fiction Short Story or Large Book Novel*...

       *COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory
       to the MASTER directory where existing .org files reference
       this contained SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP Files within
       your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

       =Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

       /(if you did by accident, simply: ~git checkout .~ to refresh)/

  =Add:= the following line to the Header of ~.Org~ Files that need to
       include this file:

       ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/fiction-book-setup.org~

/Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ /master/
/folder To your book's project directory will allow you to make your own custom/
/configurations for different books without affecting the configurations of other/
/book projects within their own MASTER FOLDERS.../

=NOTE:= The Configurations within this file depend on Harmonic Alchemy Modular
      Emacs init file: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/modules/09-4-org-export-conf.el~...

      If you need to create other LaTeX Document Styles or customize existing
      ones, you will also need to override ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~
      by placing a copy of it within: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules~ and then
      make your changes in your cloned copy...

      Find the: ~BEGIN: CUSTOM LaTeX CONFIGURATIONS for EXPORT to PDF~
      heading within that file... You can modify or add new configurations and
      even ~\\input~ external LaTeX files with even more fancy modifications...

      You will need to study *LaTeX* a LOT, and in particular, the *"memoir"* document
      class... =read the well documented docs= /(see reference section below)/

      Once you have tried this several times /(and failed)/ it won't look so
      complicated and you will begin to "get it"... /(Be Diligent! TeX/LaTeX/
      /IS a complicated Turing Complete Language... Created by one of the/
      /Geekiest GEEKS of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Algorithm Analysis!/
      /Donald Knuth... You have been warned!!!)/

      =Good luck!=
