# Install Pandoc - All Platforms

**[\[Table of Contents\]](#table-of-contents)**

**[\[Back To MAIN Modular Emacs README\]](../README.md)**

## Introduction:

As with MultiMarkdown, Emacs will run fine without Pandoc installed on your machine, However Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs will not be able to export to all those fancy document formats without Pandoc _(or Multimarkdown)_ installed...  You will consider this a broken feature once you have written something _(within Emacs)_ that needs to be exported to **LaTeX** or some fancy eBook format.  **_Read the docs for both Multimarkdown and Pandoc_** to decide how to use them.  More instructions for installing and using Pandoc can be found on their official website here: <https://pandoc.org/installing.html> The Pandoc.org website has most everything you will need all in one place!

## Install Pandoc on Mac OS:  

**You have 2 options:** HomeBrew, or build from source. I am not sure about Homebrew anymore as I don't use it, but I have found problems trying to install it with MacPorts as well now so it may be best to install from source.

- **HomeBrew:** - If you use Homebrew try this:  

```bash
  $_  brew install pandoc
```

> **Note:** If Homebrew install works for you let me know by opening an issue. Thanks!

- **Build from Source**:

After deciding not to install **HLedger** _(Haskell Stack dependent)_ via **MacPorts**, _(due to some issues I did not document)_ I will not be installing Pandoc via **MacPorts** either for the same reason... _(Pandoc was written in Haskell)_...

Now I am having issues installing Pandoc via Macports on Mac OS El Capitan as well _(testing if_ **Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs** _can run on older Mac machines)_... 

Therefore going forward, **Haskell Stack IDE**, **HLedger**, and **Pandoc** will all be installed via source on ALL my platforms... _(your mileage may vary)_

> **Note:** _(Haskell Stack IDE must be installed first before Pandoc or HLedger!)_

### Install Haskell Stack IDE

**`haskellstack.org`'s** recommended way for Mac OS (and all nx platforms for that matter) is to run the following script to install the full **Haskell** Dev Stack...

```yaml
    curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```
> **Note:** This script will ask for root access using sudo in order to install dependencies and to install the binaries to `/usr/local/bin`.

### Clone Pandoc Repo:

```yaml
$>  git clone https://github.com/jgm/pandoc
```
### Build Pandoc from source using Haskell Stack:

```yaml
$>  cd pandoc
$>  stack setup
$>  stack install
```

> **Note:** Stack setup will automatically download the **ghc** compiler if you donâ€™t have it. Stack install will install the pandoc executable into: **`~/.local/bin`**, which you should add to your **`PATH`**. This process will take a while, and will consume a considerable amount of disk space.  Also... If this is the first time you used Stack, a new full index will also be downloaded to be installed for the first time... That will take even more time! Later installs only update the index...

After all the above is done, Pandoc will be installed in: `$HOME/.local/bin`.  You may need to add that to your $PATH environment variable...

## Install Pandoc on Linux:  

> **Note:** I have been experiencing problems with Pandoc installed from package managers... Pandoc is built with Haskell.  HLedger is also written in Haskell, I had to install HLedger from source, and to do that I also installed the Haskell Stack IDE straight from Hascall.org rather than using package managers... Therefore going forward I have decided to install, **Haskell Stack IDE**, **HLedger**, and **Pandoc** locally from source on ALL my platforms going forward.  Not using package managers for any Haskell related projects... _(your mileage may vary)_

> **Note:** _(Haskell Stack IDE must be installed first before Pandoc or HLedger!)_

> Having said all the above, Pandoc is in the Debian, Ubuntu, Slackware, Arch, Fedora, NiXOS, openSUSE, and gentoo repositories so you don't have to build from source if you don't want to. Try any of the methods below and see if it works for you... _(Let me know how things go... Open up an issue about your setup...  Thanks! :octocat:)_   
Otherwise, Follow the instructions for Installing from source on Mac OS (for your Linux platform as well, skipping the instructions below)

- **Debian, Ubuntu flavors:**  

```bash
  $_  sudo apt install pandoc  
```

- **RedHat, Fedora flavors:**

```bash
  $_  sudo dnf install pandoc
```

The pandoc package installs a lot of sub-packages and can take some time to install.   Please be patient...  Updates won't take so long...

## Pandoc Usage:

Now that you have Pandoc installed, **[Download The Manual Here](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.pdf)**
