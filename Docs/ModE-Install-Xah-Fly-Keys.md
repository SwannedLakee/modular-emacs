# Modular Emacs - Install Optional Xah Fly Keys:

**[\[Back To Top README\]](../README.md)**

## Introduction:

On the **`lisp-ide` branch** I have been trying out: **`Xah-Fly-Keys`** _(a modal edit mode for Emacs!)_.  That has been a bitter-sweet experience so far...  If it helps to speed up my Emacs workflow and editing speed I am all for it!  At first I was stumbling all over myself with mis-typed keys etc.... I was cursing Xah, blaming him for lying about things etc... _(even calling him a troll - lol)_ 

However, I committed myself to try it for a bit longer. _(After spending all that time installing and configuring, I did not want that time to have been wasted eh?)_ With this new resolve I began to notice/realize I was forcing my fingers to get over bad keyboarding habits! Habits that were slowing me down, and possibly causing strain in my little fingers!

This was an epiphany for me as I am a bass player and well know the problems of bad fingerboard habits!  I stuck with Xaw's keys a bit longer and low-and-behold, I am now starting to see how fast I can go, _(once I train my damn fingers not to slip over to the dark side :space_invader: - lol)_

It is true!  You don't need to hold down the damn **Ctrl** or **Meta Key** anyomre!  But you will need the disipline, commitment, and probably about 20 hours of time to master it!  No slipping back and forth during your finger training time or you will end up reinforcing your old habits wasting all of your effort!

I think its worth trying if you are already experiencing health problems.  It's also worth trying if you think your keyboarding skills are much to slow...  I don't believe it's practical or a good idea to mix **Xah-Fly-Keys** with your old **Ctrl** and **Meta** key tricks at the same time... Especially while you are learning... Know what I mean?  Stay off them and use the **leader keys** instead...

Much patience is required before you will stop calling Xah a troll and recognize him for the vast keyboarding knowledge he offers to the world!!!  He truly knows the subject of keyboards, keyboarding efficiency and health, etc.  he did his homework, and we all benefit!  **Hey!** Would you **GNU** guys Let **[Xah Lee](https://github.com/xahlee)** into the **FSF** and add his Emacs projects to Elpa already OK? In my opinion his `Xah-Fly-Keys` is the best **Emacs** Major Modal Edit Mode available...  

I am not totally convinced a modal version of Emacs is going to be right for me, but I am sure it is right for a lot of folks out there!!!  Especially **Vi2Emacs Converts**...  This modal version of Emacs comes with your health's best intrest first priority, keeping speed and efficiency as the second priority which should be in harmony with the first priority...  I am very impressed with it so far... I don't understand some of FSF's complaints?  Maybe those are old now...

If you are interested in trying these new features out, checkout the **`origin/lisp-ide`** branch to your local machine and restart Emacs... _(Some of these new Lisp IDE Programming Language features may not work correctly at first, but as I fix things you will see things start working as expected...  If you keep your local branch updated you will be the first to find out! ;-)_ I will be updating the docs below accordingly...

Otherwise, stay on the master branch and don't install any of the _Optional_ features discussed below...
