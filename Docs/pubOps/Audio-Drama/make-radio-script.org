Come along Peter, we're almost there.

PETER
(OFF - BACK FURTHER DOWN THE PATH - RAISED VOICE TO CARRY OVER SOUND OF DISTANT WAVES, SEAGULLS, WIND)
Where Dr. Jeznik? All I can see is the remains of the old crashed down lighthouse scattered about the rocky knoll ahead of you.

DR. JEZNIK
(DIRECT - DRY - LESS BACKGROUND NOISE DR JEZNIK'S LOCAL POSITION IN FRONT OF THE IVORY TOWER)
Well my boy, that's it!  Hurry up!  I'm already there...

PETER
(DIRECT - NOW WITH DR. JEZNIK AT OPEN IRON DOOR)
(GASPS) What's all the fuss about that big old iron hatch which used to open into what used to be the basement access to the Lighthouse?  Why are you trying to open it? There's nothing but thick vines and blackberry canes all overgrown over the top of this broken Lighthouse base and it's for sure to be a tangled mess on the other side of that door as well!  We can crawl around to the other side where the entire wall is missing and I will show you!

DR. JEZNIK
(TO PETER)
Don't worry Peter, you will see shortly... There are no vines... Now help me open this heavy door!

PETER
(TO DR. JEZNIK - PARTIALLY REVERBRATED BY CHAMBER BEYOND DOOR)
Hey!  What's all that mist blocking the opening?  I would call it sea fog but it looks much thicker and iridescent cobalt blue?  I am also feeling an uncomfortable prickly feeling... (PAUSE) ([SFX-06] FOOTSTEPS AS PETER BACKS AWAY FROM DOOR)
(NERVOUSLY) Yikes!  Dr. J ... Um... the hair on my arm went all static electricity like until I let go of that door!  That fog feels tingly and very thick and sticky!  I don't feel good about this!  (GASP) What's Happening?

DR. JEZNIK
(TO PETER - PARTIALLY REVERBRATED BY CHAMBER BEYOND DOOR)
Hold fast to my hand boy!  We need to be grounded before coming in contact with the event horizon... I am putting my right hand through now...  Just stay close behind me and you will be fine...

PETER
(TO DR. JEZNIK - ALARMING TONE - PARTIALLY REVERBRATED BY CHAMBER BEYOND DOOR)
Yikes! Did you just get a shock from that cloud? Maybe we shouldn't go any...
(PAUSE - AD LIB RELUCTANCE TO ENTER CHAMBER - FADE UNDER)

DR. JEZNIK

Um... I feel rearllry... dizzy.... (ETC) My ears ringing like crazy... Ringing! Ringinggggggg! Make it STOP!  Please!!!
(LOOSE CONSCIOUSNESS FOR 5 SECOND PAUSE - GAIN FACULTIES - REGAIN NORMAL SPEECH)
Uh... hmmm.... Oh... Oh My! ... That was a strange feeling ... (RECOVERING) like my brain just dissapeared and reappeared several times and leapfrogged around all the while my ears were ringing like crazy!  Faint echos of ringing still remain... fading in and then going away...
