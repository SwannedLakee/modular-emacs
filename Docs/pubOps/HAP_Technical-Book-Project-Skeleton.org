#+DESCRIPTION: HAP - Tech Manual Book Project Skeleton with generic basics already done. Great for documenting technical projects, large or small... Also great for organizing, handling caveats, trying different methods, etc. All while building a sound outline of support docs, steps, best practices... and publishable as a PDF Book suitable for eBook readers... (easily modified for publishing in other eBook formats or for the web)

☞ =Instructions:= /(How to Install & Use This Template)/

To use *HAP_Technical-Book-Project-Skeleton.org* /(Org-Mode Reference Book Project /Template)/ for your own projects, perform the following steps: 

/Use the org-mode Checkboxes to Help You Keep Track of Progress/

1) [ ] *Clone a Copy of This File:* 

      Put your clone where you normally organize your writing 
      projects. *Place it within its own master folder... It is*
      *Important to keep this file within its OWN enclosing folder!* 

      Name the project's master folder to reflect your Reference book 
      project's title... /(what you renamed this .org file to)/...

      =Other Files/Folders will be placed within this master folder...=

2) [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./media~ /(and contents)/ *to your new project's Master Folder:*

      Copy this directory /(into your master folder as a sibling of this file).../ 
      Any external documents or images referenced by your book project should 
      be placed within this ~./media/~ directory...

      All external links, images, within the boilerplate examples of this
      template may be used as examples for getting your own images, and 
      external attachments linked properly...  

      This single ~./media~ directory will serve media and external attachments 
      for all of the ~.org~ doc template files from within: ~.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps~ 
      directory /(if they were also copied here to your Project's Master Folder)/

      =Note:=  You DON'T need to copy the ~./auto/~ directory...  That directory
             will be automatically created the first time you export this ~.org~ 
             file to ~.PDF~...

3) [ ] *Copy/Clone:* ~./org-templates~ /(and all contents)/ *to your Master Folder:*

      Copy this directory to your book's MASTER FOLDER,
      /(i.e., as a sibling/ /of this .org file).../ 

      =Note:= The SETUPFILES Within this directory which are called out and 
            included by this .org file /(above)/ must stay within this
            directory...  

            Other SETUPFILES within this directory are used by other book 
            project templates and are not needed for this Technical Book
            Project... You may remove them if you wish...

            They are small text files not bothering you... If you clone
            another ~HAP_<book-template>.org~ file into this project folder
            it will pick up its associated SETUPFILES automatically, so
            consider that if/when you decide to delete other
            UNUSED SETUPFILES...

4) [ ] =Start Sketching Out Your Technical Book NOW Before You Loose It!=

      =NOTE:= You may be doing this because you have technical information that
             needs to be writtin now before you forget!  =Right?=  Therefore...
             as soon as you are done with the first steps above, =STOP= and go
             immediately to the:

                   [[~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules/emojis/Dabolus-Complete-Emoji-Collection/u1F4A1.png]] *Ideas Scratchpad Refile / ☞ Start Here!*

             section and read the ~:README:~ directly under that heading...  
             Then write your ideas down quickly /(as per the README instructions)/ 
             to get your information recorded before you forget it...  

             Later, After you have all your ideas sketched out and you are 
             ready to be in an ="organized mood"= /(rather than creative mood)/ 
             /This does not imply being organized cannot be a CREATIVE PROCESS/ 
             Then it is time to:

             =Come Back Here And Finish Setting Up Your Project...=

             *This Project Template is HUGE!*

             *Your Muse Can Easily Loose Her Inspiration!*

             =The ☞ Start Here Section is Your Remedy= 

             =Do That first!=

5) [ ] *Finish Setting up this Project LATER...* [0/3]

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your Technical Book Project's Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Change to: /"your-tehcnical-Book-Project's-Title.pdf"/
          This will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
          /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Copyright © 2022:~ *directive top of this file:*

          Change to: /"Copyright © your info here"/ You are the copyright
          owner of your own documents created from clones of these master
          templates... /(but these MASTER Template Files are to stay under/
          /Harmonic Alchemy Productions copyright. Any Attribution to me/
          /for the template structure of your published docs will be/
          /appreciated... but unnecessary... Thanks! ;-)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+AUTHOR:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your NAME"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EMAIL:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Change to: /"your EMAIL"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DATE:~ *TIMESTAMP at the top of this file:* 

          Put your cursor on the TIMESTAMP: /i.e.,/ <2022-10-05 Wed>
          and type: ~C-c . . RETURN~ The TIMESTAMP will update to NOW.
          Do this whenever you update your doc to show last date
          it was changed or modified...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Created:~ *TIMESTAMP at the top of this file:* 

          Put your cursor on the TIMESTAMP: /i.e.,/ <2022-10-05 Wed>
          and type: ~C-c . . RETURN~ The TIMESTAMP will update to NOW.

          =LEAVE THIS DATE ALONE after Setting It The FIRST Time=

          This Date reflects the time/date that you first created this
          new document It should NEVER change after that...

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TEXT: Last Published:~ *TIMESTAMP at Publish Time:* 

          =Don't Change This UNTIL You Have Actually Exported This File=
          /(as a PDF or HTML, etc. and have PUBLISHED it publically somewhere)/

          Until that publishing time comes leave it alone as: <not-published>
          
          As soon as this is published or re-published, Replace the
          <unpublished> placeholder with a REAL TIMESTAMP by typing:
          ~C-c . . RETURN~ The new Last Published: <TIMESTAMP> will
          appear in place... Do this EVERY time you publish or update
          an existing publishing... /(this will help you keep track)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+FILETAGS:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

          Add your own tags that match the context of your Log Book...
          
    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:*

          Compose /Your-Technical-Book-Project's Description/ as a short 
          paragraph here...

    - *The* ~./media~ *Directory is ALL Set:* 

         Any external documents or images referenced by ANY book projects
         located within this MASTER FOLDER, should be placed within this
         ~./media/~ directory... This single ~./media~ directory will serve
         media and external attachments for this and any other related
         ~.org~ files you may end up creating here, as well as being
         the media repository used by LaTeX during publishing...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./auto/~ *Directory:* /(you do not need to copy this)/

         This is or will-be an auto generated folder where your output ~.PDF~ 
         files are created and placed during LaTeX export. You DO NOT need 
         to copy this folder as it is auto generated during org-mode LaTeX 
         processing...

         LaTeX processing will not delete any prior files contained here... 
         Some of them will be updated, but will have backups...  Any files 
         you place within this folder will NOT be lost, unless you delete 
         them... This folder is a good place to store other temporary files 
         you may be creating, generating.. etc...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./org-templates~  *Directory:*

         The files in here are automatically linked and included within this
         template. You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to
         customize the already customized tags, and export options.

         /They are allready set up correctly for the Technical Book genre, and/
         /the Category is all set as well... But you can and may modify the/
         /SETUPFILES to fit your needs.../

6) [ ] =Ongoing Planning / Writing Your Technical Book:= 

      /Change headings and structure to match your project's outline/ 
      /sections-chapters, figures, etc.../

      *Start doing the Tasks within the Tasks section:*

      =Have fun doing this...=

7) [ ] =Export/Publish to PDF File:=

      The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the SETUPFILES above will 
      get this file looking good when exported as a Standard PDF file.  
      Once you have your project directory all set up as above you are 
      ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

         *Issue the following Emacs command:*

            ~M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf~

         *OR* If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys* /"Command Mode"/ Try Shortcut:

            ~SPACE e p~

         *OR Export to OTHER Formats:*

            ~C-c C-e~

            /(a pop-up will show allowing you to choose export method)/

      After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., new files by the name of: ~HAP_Untitled-Tech-Manual.pdf~ -and- ~HAP_Untitled-Tech-Manual.tex~ 
      will appear within the same directory as this file...

      Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your existing ~HAP_Untitled-Tech-Manual.pdf~ -and- ~HAP_Untitled-Tech-Manual.tex~ 
      files! /(make backups first if needed!)/
      
      You should probably copy these files to the ~./auto/~ directory as 
      well for safe keeping as backups...

      =If you chose the last option above= LaTeX will output files with other
      extensions for those other output formats... =NOTE:= SETUPFILES have not
      been created yet for other eBook formats.  /(This is a work in progress)/

      =If YOU EXPERIENCE LaTeX ERRORS:= 

         *Consult Buffer:* ~*Org PDF LaTeX Output*~

8) [ ] =Handling Images=

      All Images /(by DEFAULT from above elisp source code block)/ are set
      to thumbnail size (to properly size the .png ICONS /(emojis)/ in front
      of Binder Headings etc...

      This means that Other images within your ~.org~ file will ALSO display
      as small thumbnails...

      If that is NOT what you want for some images, you can override the
      DEFAULT by using local attributes above the image link...

      Use *LaTeX* and/or *HTML* attributes as follows on the images that need
      to be a different size...

      =Example:=
      
         #+CAPTION: Example larger size .png file 
         #+NAME:  example:00001
         #+attr_html: :width 200px
         #+attr_latex: :width 200px
      [[~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules/emojis/Dabolus-Complete-Emoji-Collection/u1F3D5.png]]

=These Instructions Were Last Modified:= <2022-12-18 Sun> 

So far Export to PDF in nice Technical or Reference Book Style format... This has not been tested for HTML or other eBook formats yet... We will get fancy with other formats later... I promice... I have to do all this documentation first!

/As you can see, if you been following for the past couple years, things are getting done! Albeit Slowly/

=Please Open an ISSUE At:= https://github.com/harmonicalchemy/modular-emacs/issues
   
Please use Issues to Ask Questions, Report Problems/Bugs etc., and Suggest Ideas for Improvement... =You guys are my Product Managers=  I am only a User of ONE "seat".

** [[~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules/emojis/Dabolus-Complete-Emoji-Collection/u1F449.0.png]] Start Here!
:README:
   This Section is mainly to accommodate "seat-of-pants" writers
          /(Of Which I Have Been Accused Of.../
           /But I Also Crave The Planning Stuff)/. 

   I often come here for my [[https://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html]["yak shaving"]] adventures...

   Use this: "*💡 Scratchpad Refile ☞ Start Here!*" section as a 
   quick place to document ideas and inspirations as they come 
   along... You can refile them later... 

   Even if your quick inspiration was intended for elsewhere?,
   /(e.g., You become bored documenting tedious technical/ 
   /information when suddenly, out-of-nowhere, an idea for a/ 
   /new sci-fi scene in that screenplay episode you had in the/ 
   /back of your mind all day!, etc.)/

   =Ummm.... Parallel Universe?=

   =Sure!= You can put anything in here! We've got that covered 
         for you in this Start Here spot. %^)

   Use this section to quickly capture inspired at-the-moment 
   ideas =While they are still fresh in mind=

   =How To Use ???= 

      /Simply Come directly here and do what ever you want.../
      /"Your Crazy Daze are Covered!" Yay!/ 

   =The following Shortcuts= Will Help you Get Started as 
   Quickly as Possible:

   - [ ] *Copy/Clone:* =Example Idea= *Heading Below:* 

         =Copy the Heading AND ALL ITS CONTENTS=

         /Change your Clone's Title to Your Own Title/

   - [ ] *Change the timestamp on your Clone Entry:* [0/1]

         =Type:= ~C-c .~ while cursor is sitting on the timestamp

         /i.e., Press: ~Ctrl-c~, let go, and then type a Period/ ~.~

         A date chooser panel will pop up...

     + [ ] *Press* ~ENTER~ *to auto accept today's date and time.*  

            The existing timestamp will change to TODAY...

   - [ ] *Advance your cursor and Start Writing!!!*

          Advance your cursor few more lines down to some fresh 
          empty space and Start Typing Your Story Idea Like Mad!!! 

   - [ ] *Don't stop Writing!* 

          Don't worry about formatting or organizing it until later, 
          after all your inspiration has passed and you are ready 
          to organize...

   - [ ] =TODO After You Are Done Writing:=

        + [ ] *Adjust Space:* 

               Adjust space between your headings and your 
               fantastic ideas below them it to one single 
               blank line...

        + [ ] *Further organize things as needed...*

               If you become inspired to write while organizing... 
               Do that first and come back later... Don't scare 
               away your muses when they beckon! Get your story 
               down first! No matter what state it may be in at 
               first... =GET IT DOWN=

        + [ ] *You Are Free To Go Out And Play Elsewhere Little Grasshopper*

               If after writing... You don't feel like organizing 
               now? =NO PROBLEM=... But come back later and organize 
               things... =OK?= Don't create a swamp in here! 
               /And don't forget to take/ /your bath tonight... ;-)/

   Having done the simple steps above any time you get inspired, you 
   will be able to tell your grand children.. "I got my first spark 
   of an idea for that book back in Year, Month, Day, time, second" 
   /(50 years later!)/ Now that is being organized! LOL
:END:
*** NEW [[~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules/emojis/Dabolus-Complete-Emoji-Collection/u1F4A1.png]] <2020-06-07 Sun> My New Business Idea! /(example)/
:README:
   This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have 
   gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something 
   elsewhere within this project...  After you are done getting as 
   much of the idea as you initally can then you can simply go back 
   to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... 
   You might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

   Later when you are free you can come back to file this or place it 
   where it belongs.  In the case of the note below it would probably 
   go in a research folder of a Sci-Fi related project...

:README:
   =Use this space to write the main synopsis of your technical work=

   You can write anything you want here but it is highly recommended 
   to use the award winning *"Snowflake Method"* created by [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/][Randy Ingermanson]] 
   of Ingermanson Communications, Inc. 

   =YES!= It is a perfectly great idea to use Randy's Snowflake Method for 
        the development of Reference or Technical Books...
        /(Companies spend tons of money sending their top execs off to/ 
        /"Vision Retreats" for this same reason)/ It will Make them Better
        at what they do day-to-day...

   Snowflake concepts apply just as well for real-worlds as they do for  
   make-believe worlds... /(the worlds don't care or notice the difference)/

   The steps within the *⏰ Tasks:* Binder follow guidelines within Randy's
   book... Boilerplate forms have been set up for you to fill out while 
   reading his book to get a deeper understanding behind these dry forms 
   and worksheets...

   - [ ] *Go to the:* [[~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules/emojis/Dabolus-Complete-Emoji-Collection/u23F1.png]] Tasks: *Binder and do the: 📃 *Synopsis Tasks:*

   - [ ] *After Completing Tasks Mark Them:* ~DONE~

   - [ ] *Place Resulting Synopsis in Here:*

         Copy the one-page skeleton from: =Step Three= of Synopsis Tasks
         to HERE to serve as this books official Synopsis...

   When you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have 
   completed half the battle of writing your technical work! 
   Everything else you write will flow out of that initial seed...

   You will be coming back here to consult these notes for many 
   things as you promote and publish your book.

This is a secret Org-Mode Tutorial /(presented here as an EXAMPLE Chapter)/ for a technical book...  Some good tips are in here so you may want to save this somewhere else before removing or re-writing it to use as a chapter within the technical book you have commondeerred this project skeleton for...

In Particular, here are some *Org-Mode publishing tips and snippits* I have found along the way...  Some of them may get incorporated more formally later /(with docs, etc.),/ but for now... you will have to =discover these treasures below= within this =example chapter=...

This initial draft only contains Ref Links...  I did a lot of re-configuring of this template to get it looking good when exported to PDF...  I discuss some of the hurdles I ran into getting all this done, /(and the tricks I learned)/ as next sub topics below... That will be done later... /(all in good time)/

:README:
   =What is Yak Shaving doing in your Research Folder?= Just as the name 
   implies, this is a place that may have no business being in your book, 
   but nevertheless may be something you need to research on the side in 
   order to get your book written.. 

   Things to put here may end up in chapters but you don't know which 
   chapters that may be at this point, so you cannot use a Chapter's 
   Background Notes section for these cases...

   Use this section as a place to save and organize new-ideas while you 
   figure out what they may be for, and where they may eventually go...  

   This section is a great place to start if your are importing existing 
   docs written in markdown, or Open Office, or what ever... import the 
   text from those external docs here first... Then you can organize them 
   here while you figure out how they fit in the larger context of a book 
   project...

   The format for this section is anything you like.. And you may put 
   anything you like in here.. There are NO Templates to clone for this...
   =MAKE IT HOW YOU WANT TO MAKE IT HERE... ;-P=

   Some of the things written *seat-of-the-pants* within the *Start Here* 
   section may end up in this *Yak Shaving* section later when you are 
   ready to organize things further... /(after inspiration)/

   =Using the Clocking Feature of this Log Entry=

   - [ ] *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:*

         /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

         =Punch the Time Clock:= /(see Clocking Commands: below)/ At
         the heading And then begin working on a task related to
         that Heading...

         =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= /(you will see a/ *:clocking:*
         /item under the heading where time is recorded)/

   - [ ] =Use These Clocking Commands:= /to keep track your time.../

      + *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

            This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
            underneath the HEADING...

            Do this just before starting work on the task... 
            Be in control of your life!

            After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
            work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
            other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
            be recording your time all the while... You will see 
            in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
            as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
            and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

            /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

            You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
            while and you need to come back to update the item's
            info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
            do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

            This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
            ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the clock)/

            The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end
            timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

            =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e., Leaving
            a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it
            dangling with the file closed only to open it again and
            get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/
            /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always
            come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to
            amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc...
            Whatever...

                  ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

            This command will change the total time at the end showing 
            your new calculated time...

            If you need to go away and do something else before finishing
            this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come
            back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card
            Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear
            above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When
            you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry
            below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

            When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
            command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
            /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
            /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
            So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
            marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
            /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
            /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

            This removes currently running clock and forgets any time
            accrued or associated with it...

      + ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

            /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
            =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                     within your org file with those timestamps!!!

   more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

   Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This

   The Synopsis Tasks provided below are important first steps to take 
   when first starting any book.  They are based on the "Snowflake Method" 
   by Randy Ingermanson... /(for fiction writers)/ but the universal
   visualization concepts apply for reference and technical works as well.

   These tasks should be started as soon as you create a new project 
   using this: *HAP_Technical-Book-Project-Skeleton* 

   It is hoped that this process will give you a faster, efficient, 
   organized "bootstrapped" head start and teach some guidance about 
   how to properly organize and write your books with a clearer mind, 
   inspired outlook, and renewed motivation...
:END:
** 📃 Synopsis Tasks:
:README:
   =Do These Synopsis Tasks FIRST When Starting a NEW Tech Book Project=

   After completing each Timestamped Step below, Mark its TODO 
   state to ~DONE~ and update the timestamp to the current time as
   well...  Use Command: ~C-c . RET~ while cursor is on the timestamp
   to update it to the current date/time... 

   The Synopsis Tasks below are based on The Award winning Snowflake 
   Method created by [[https://www.advancedfictionwriting.com/][Randy Ingermanson]] of Ingermanson Communications, 
   Inc. You could write anything you want for a synopsis...

   Randy Wrote his book with Novelist /(fiction writers)/ in mind but
   I believe these same principals apply to real-life as well...
   Of course... Right?  Fiction and Real Life are not ALL that
   different at the end of the day... Just be sure not to be writing
   any "fake news" OK? Thanks... We really don't need any more of that.

   =It is HIGHLY Recommended= for you to use the steps below FIRST 
   before doing any other writing! This advise comes from many 
   highly acclaimed authors! Not just Randy...
:END:
*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Do This First: =Important=

=NOTE:= Before you start you need to answer the 
      following questions:

- [ ] *What is your main category or genera?*

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *You write within this genera because?*

       _______________________________________

- [ ] *Readers will be attracted to and enjoy your books because?*

       _______________________________________


After completing above, follow the steps below...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step One - Write a Single Sentence Summary:

=Take An Hour And Write A One-Sentence Summary Of Your Book:= 
   
*Something like this:*

   /"A gourmet chef from Boston acedentally falls into a parallel/ 
    /world, almost destroyed by an arch enemy he did not even know/ 
    /he had, then he discovers he is immortal and meets-re-discovers/ 
    /his ancient soul mate of eons. Together they save the universe/ 
    /after all else fails!"/

OK I know... I cheated. The second sentence is a stinger. It needs to stand alone... I often buck the rules... lol

The sentence you end up writing above will serve you forever as a ten-second selling tool. This exercise defines the big picture illustrated by the first simple triangle in the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and/ /classmates by Baby Bear in: Chapter 4 of Randy Ingermanson's Book:/ 
/"How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

Within that same chapter, Baby Bear also pointed out this important fact to keep in mind: 

   /(Illustrated "Radio Drama" Style Just For Fun, Because We Can... ;-)/

#+BEGIN_SRC fountain

                   "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method"
                                by: Randy Ingermanson

# Somewhere in the middle of Scene One:

INT. (BABY BEAR'S CLASSROOM - DAY)

_1. SOUND [CREAKING & THUD OF TABLE AS BABY BEAR JUMPS UP ON TOP]_

2.

BABY BEAR
(RECOVERING BALANCE, GRUNT, DEEP ENHALE)
    
This is important, you novelists!
   
You're going to get lots of advice on how to write a novel.  
    
But that's all it is. Advice. If you don't like that advice, 
    
if it doesn't work for you, then ignore it.  
    
If it does work for you, then run with it.

#+END_SRC

I agree... Don't let anybody steer you away from your muses! But at the same time don't ignore the basics!

This synopsis stuff is basic to the bone! It is universal... We cannot buck it!  It's based on human nature... Your sentence above, will serve as a pitch during normal conversations /(to see if there is any interest)/...

=Memorize "your line"= to the point that you can say it in your sleep! Turn it into a "slogan" /(hopefully a "meme" if you are the lucky type)/. Your goal is that others will remember and be able to easily tell all their friends /(word/ /for word)/. Networking is the key! You can't do it alone... Songs are also great help! /(cartoons and songs are killer!)/ Social networks open you up to sky limit possibilities!

=Lead with your story line while engaging with a total stranger= or even your mother. =Remain silent after that=... Wait to see if there is interest before diving deeper... That and your good body language "posture" will take care of everything...

=Important!= Closing rules of sales dictate the law of attraction 
           always applies.. Pushing yields negative results... 
           =If you push people... They push back...= 

           =If you run away from people, they chase you...= 

           To eat, or to be eaten... That's what it all comes down to. 
           lol Wait to see if there is interest... 

           =If NOT, Move On...= 
           =If YES... Do The Next Step...=

When the time comes for you to write your book proposal, this sentence should appear very early in the proposal. It's the hook that will sell your book to your editor, to your committee, to the sales force, to bookstore owners, and ultimately to readers. So make the best one you can!

***** Here are some tips:

- *Shorter is better. Try for fewer than 15 words.*

- *No character names, please!* 

   Better to say "a handicapped trapeze artist" than "Jane Doe".

- *Tie together the big picture and the personal picture.* 

   Which character has the most to lose in this story? 
   Now tell me what he or she wants to win.

- *Read the one-line blurbs on the New York Times Bestseller list* 

   This will teach you how to do it by example. Writing a 
   one-sentence description is an art form. If you become a 
   master at this, marketing firms will want you madly!

- *Check out:* [[yt:feD-dImM4a8][LEGO Star Wars: The Last Jedi in 60 Seconds]] 

   /(and other 60 second movies like it)/ for a completely 
   different audio/visual parallel to this literary concept...
   
*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Two - Expand Summary to Paragraph

=Take another hour and expand your sentence= from step one into a full paragraph describing brief overview, technical requirements or challenges, and ending with your proposed solution in a single sentence.

This step defines the second stage of the snowflake model... as illustrated by further trisections of the triangle producing the snowflake diagram /(as explained to Goldilocks and classmates by Baby Bear in chapter 5, "The Importance of being Disastrous" in Randy Ingermanson's book: "How to Write a Novel Using the Snowflake Method")/

For this step, *visualize the story as having "three disasters plus an ending"* 
In the sense of Reference and Technical Books, Manuals, etc. Think of "disasters" simply as business or technical challenges, which in fact can be real disasters... So there is really no difference... at the end of the day...

Each of the disasters takes a quarter of the book to develop and the ending takes the final quarter. I bet this formula is the same for development and
exposition of your technical material and final solutions or conclusions...

No one claims this to be an absolute ideal structure, but it's the one that Randy Ingermanson uses, and it has a strong basis in psychology.

=If you believe in the Three-Act structure, then:=

- *The first disaster /(challenge)/ would correspond to the end of Act 1*

- *The second disaster /(challenge)/ would be the mid-point of Act 2*

- *The third disaster /(challenge)/ would come at the end of Act 2,
   and force Act 3*

- *Act 3 wraps everything up* /(and provides a final solution or
   conclusion for your technical book...)/

**** Make 5 Sentences: [0/5]

1. [ ] =Exposition:=

   The first sentence paints the big picture of the problem 
   with a hint of its solution. The purpose of this sentence 
   is to invoke a strong curiosity, desire, and expectation 
   to learn the rest of the book's proposed solution!

2. [ ] =Second Sentence:= - *This Sets Current Playing Field*

   Outline the circumstances of the current playing field that 
   your book will be addressing. This is the key event that 
   motivated you to find a remedy in the first place.  This 
   section must hit home to our readers as well, inspiring 
   them to follow the rest of the book for answers...

3. [ ] =The third sentence:= - *Tells them what NOT to do* 

   =Sharing Personal Blunders Is A Sure Hit For Readers=

   Here is where you get to tell some stories... past experience 
   of failed attempts etc.  Not offering the proper solutions yet, 
   but rather showing the palm face human events that finally lead 
   you to discovery of the proper methods & solutions...
   /(the music changes, new hope emerges out of the fog of your mess)/

4. [ ] =The forth sentence:= - *Where You Git To Hit The Home Run!*

   This sentence reveals your final best solution to all the 
   challenges presented, giving your readers the impression that 
   =reading this book will help them avoid all pitfalls entirely!=

5. [ ] =Summary:= *(conclusion)*

   This last sentence wraps everything up, further supporting 
   the first three sentences with one single statement.  An 
   encouragement and also challenge for your readers to read 
   this book to discover more.

 

**** Using Your One-Paragraph Summary:

You will be using this paragraph in your proposals. It is only for your agents etc.  Not for your readers who need to be kept in the dark about 
too many details until they read the book...

=However=, Some of this paragraph /(written with parts pourposefully left out or with questions put in place)/ may end up back-cover copy for your book's promotion.

 

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Step Three - Expand Paragraph to Synopsis:

=Take several hours and expand each sentence= of your summary paragraph into a full paragraph. 

*All but the last paragraph should present challenges, pitfalls to overcome.* The final paragraph is your proposed best-practice solution.

By this stage, you should have a good idea of the large-scale structure of your book, and you have only spent a day or two, or at most, a week or two, but all that time will not have been wasted! You will now have a good idea if there are going to be problems that need to be worked out. This is good knowledge to have now, rather than after investing 500 hours in a rambling first draft.

At the end of this exercise, you will have a nice one-page skeleton of your book. It's fine if your skeleton does not fit all on one single-spaced page as long as it does not go beyond that...

Your process now is to grow these ideas as individual chapters and topics.  You have a synopsis "executive summary" suitable for a proposal, and you are well on your way to doing extended promotion...

*** NEW ⏱ <2022-08-25 Thu> Completion:

- [ ] *Copy one-page skeleton from:* =Step Three= above to the main
      *📃 Synopsis:* Section of this book project...

      When you are done with these Synopsis tasks, you will have 
      completed half the battle of writing your technical work! 
      Everything else you write will flow out of that initial seed...

** ⏱ Other Tasks:
*** SOMEDAY ⏱ <2022-08-28 Sun> Create Editorial Calendar

=Note:= This is Still Under Construction... I am researching the 
      best way to use agenda, calendar views, and Tables to make 
      an Editorial Calendar work well in Emacs Org-Mode...

Make an *Editorial* for this project! You will need this for quick access during publishing time. Org-Mode excels for this task!  Take advantage of its powerful scheduling, agenda, and filtering capabilities!

Use this space to design your *EC* and then transfer it as a New Top Level

            while and you need to come back to update the item's
            info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
            do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

            This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
            ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the clock)/

            The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end
            timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

            =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e., Leaving
            a clock running all day by accident, or worse, leave it
            dangling with the file closed only to open it again and
            get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do you want to do/
            /with this?"/ If you do something like that you can always
            come back and directly edit the clock times by hand to
            amend them...  After changing clock times or dates, etc...
            Whatever...

                  ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

            This command will change the total time at the end showing 
            your new calculated time...

            If you need to go away and do something else before finishing
            this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come
            back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card
            Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear
            above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When
            you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry
            below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

            When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
            command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
            /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
            /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
            So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
            marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
            /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
            /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

            This removes currently running clock and forgets any time
            accrued or associated with it...

      + ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

            /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
            =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                     within your org file with those timestamps!!!

**** NEW ✅ Summary: [0/3]
:README:
   This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you
   cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the
   top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content,
   then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly
   scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what
   you were looking for... 

   Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give
   more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

   Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This
   list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I
   personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two
   line description containing important keywords right here and
   nothing more. I think that is more useful...
