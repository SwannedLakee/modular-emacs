  =YOU MAY REMOVE This Drawer= from your own clones of this template if
  it is bothering you... This drawer is used for HAP Modular Emacs
  DOC TEMPLATES housekeeping...

  =HOWEVER= you may also use it for the same purpose to keep your existing
  Modular Emacs based org documents in sync with the latest updates of the
  template they were created from...
  
  =If you do wish to do the same... Read On Below...=

        *DO THIS ALWAYS*, JUST AFTER YOU UPDATE THIS SETUPFILE...

    + [ ] =Change this= *:LATEST_UPDATE:* =drawer title:= /(within clones only)/

         Change it to: *:LATEST_TEMPLATE_UPDATE:* within NEWLY CREATED CLONES...

    + [ ] *COMPARE the TIMESTAMPS between THIS TEMPLATE and CLONES:*

         ~Org-Mode~ and ~AuxTeX~ settings and meta data within CLONES of
         this SETUPFILE TEMPLATE will get out of sync after a while due
         to Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs version updates etc...
        
         Use the ABOVE timestamp /(within the TEMPLATE and your CLONE)/
         to see if the clone's settings need to be updated...
         /(i.e., brought into sync with its template - MERGE)/ and then
         perform any needed merging/replacing of BOILERPLATE and/or
         meta data. /(e.g, *:README:* drawers, etc.)/

    + [ ] *Keep ABOVE timestamp within CLONES of this template UP TO DATE:*

         =AFTER Completing Above MERGE Step= and your clone has been brought
         up to date /(i.e. in sync)/ with its STARTUPFILE TEMPLATE...
         Then update the timestamp ABOVE... /(WITHIN YOUR CLONE)/ to record
         the date of its last sync status...

This file is included as part of *Harmonic Alchemy Modular Emacs* to provide an example of how ~org-tags~ are organized by *Modular Emacs* as installed out-of-box
on your machine... You can change FILE LOCAL tags HERE for your own purposes...

=NOTE:= In addition to *FILE LOCAL TAGS*... A set of *GLOBALLY defined TAGS*
      are available to ALL .org files opened within a HAP Modular Emacs
      configuration...
      
      *GLOBAL TAGS* get assigned within: ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~

- [ ] *USAGE:* [0/4]
  
   /Follow These Steps to Use Out-Of-Box, or Customize with Your Own Tags.../

   + [ ] *COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory
          to your MASTER PROJECT directory where existing ~.org~ files reference
          this contained default-tags SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP
          Files within your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

          =Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

          =VERIFY:= the following line in preamble heading of ~.Org~ Files
          includes this file...
          /(this is the default - which you could change to something else)/

              ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/default-tags.org~

      /Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~
      /master folder To your book's project directory will allow you to/
      /make your own custom configurations for different books without/
      /affecting the configurations of other book projects within their/
      /own MASTER FOLDERS.../

   + [ ] =CONSULT:= the =Defined TAG Shortcut KEYS:= Section to see which TAG/KEY
         assignments are already set by default... BOTH Global and Local TAG/KEY
         assignment pairs are listed...

   + [ ] =ADD NEW LOCAL TAG/KEY Assignments:=

          /(or modify existing LOCAL assignments)/

          HERE you may /(if you need)/ modify or Replace any of the FILE LOCAL
          TAG/KEY assignments to create your own custom ~xxx-tags.org~
          SETUPFILE...

          You may ADD NEW or Change any of the FILE LOCAL tags and key
          assignments to fit your categorical needs...

          =CONSULT:= the *CURRENT KEYS - FREE to USE & DEFINE LOCALLY:* list to
                   see which key assignments are free and available to make...
                   If you make changes, update this list as well as the
                   *FILE LOCAL DEFINED KEYS:* list...

          Realize some of the already defined FILE LOCAL TAGS are of a General
          and USEFUL Nature for most use-cases that you may not want to change...
   
          Therefore those general purpose tags /(e.g., must_read, etc.,)/ should
          probably be left as is..., or at least, assign NEW shortcut KEYs to them.
          /(if you have a better TAG in mind that fits that particular keyboard KEY
           better than it does to the existing default TAG assignment)/

   + [ ] =DO NOT MODIFY ANY GLOBALLY DEFINED Shortcht TAG/KEY Assignments=

          The GLOBALLY DEFINED Shortcut KEYS Assign TAGS for =ALL .ORG FILES=
          Globally... These TAGS are defined within:
      
             ~09-2-org-keywords-tags-conf.el~

          These keys are conveniently listed for your inspection under:
          the *GLOBALLY DEFINED KEYS* list above...
        
          =You CANNOT use these KEYS to define FILE LOCAL TAGS!=

          /(If you try, your KEY choices will be SHADOWED by DEFAULTS/
           /and will not work)/
