* ☞ Instructions: /(How to Install & Use This Template)/ :noexport:
** =Read Me First!=

To use this Audio Drama Project Skeleton /(template)/ for your own projects, perform the following steps: /(use the org-mode checkboxes help you keep track of progress)/

1. [ ] *Copy/Clone ALL of the:* ~../Audio-Drama~ *Folder /(and its contents)/ as* 
       *Your NEW Audio Project:* 

       In order to use this Audio Drama Project Skeleton properly so that 
       default Settings work, you need to *copy the ENTIRE folder* containing 
       this file and *ALL its contents*, renaming it from: =Audio-Drama= to 
       =Your Specific Name= or =Title= of your new Audio Drama Project...

       Put your new renamed Audio Drama Project Skeleton /(folder)/ where 
       you normally organize your audio drama or podcast projects.

       =OK you did that?  Now You Are READY to Start your Story!=

2. [ ] =Start Sketching Out Your Story NOW Before You Loose It!=

      =NOTE:= You may be doing this because you have some fantastic story idea
             brewing in your mind and you need to write that down before you 
             forget!  =Right?=  Therefore... as soon as you clone this file,
             =STOP= and go immediately to the:

                   ~💡 Ideas Scratchpad Refile / ☞ Start Here!~ 

             section and read the ~:README:~ directly under that heading...  
             Then write your idea down quickly /(as per the README instructions)/ 
             to get your inspiration recorded before you forget it...  

             Later, After you have all your ideas sketched out and you are ready to be in an ="organized mood"= /(rather than creative mood)/ Then it is
             time to =Come back here and finish setting up your project...=

             *This Project Template is HUGE!*

             *Your Muse Can Easily Loose Her Inspiration!*

             =The ☞ Start Here Section is Your Remedy= 

             =Do That first!=

3. [ ] =Finish Setting up this Project later...= [0/3]

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+TITLE:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Change it to /"Your Audio Drama Project's Title"/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+EXPORT_FILE_NAME:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Also change this directive to: /"Your-Audio-Drama-Project's-Title.pdf"/ 
           That will be the file name(s) produced during export thence forward
           /(including auto generated files: .tex, etc...)/

    - [ ] *Change the* ~#+DESCRIPTION:~ *directive at the top of this file:* 

           Compose /Your-Audio-Drama-Project's Description/ as a short paragraph here...

    - *The* ~./media~ *Directory is ALL Set:* 

         Any external documents or images referenced by your audio project 
         should be placed within this ~./media/~ directory... This single ~./media~ 
         directory will serve media and external attachments for this and any 
         other extra audio drama ~.org~ files you may end up creating here, as well 
         as being the media repository used by LaTeX during publishing... You will 
         also be using this ~./media/~ directory for all finished sound media, 
         /(e.g., sound-effects, loops, music, etc.)/ that are called out within 
         the cue sheets /(also contained within this ~.org~ project)/ 

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./bin~ *Directory:*

         This folder is needed to run programs that convert your ~.fountain~ scripts into PDF or other formats...

    - *Purpose of the:* ~./auto/~ *Directory:*

         This is where your output ~.PDF~ files will be placed during export. 

    - *Purpose of the:* ~~./org-templates~~  *Directory:*

         The files in here are automatically linked and included within this
         template. You don't need to change those settings unless you wish to
         customize the already customized tags, and export options.

         /They are allready set up correctly for the audio drama genre, and the category is all set as well... But you can and may modify the original files to fit your needs.../

=Ongoing Project TASKS:=

1. [ ] *Planning / Writing Your Audio Drama:* 

       /Change headings and structure to match your project's outline episodes-scenes-plots-characters, etc./ 

       =Do the Tasks within the Tasks section...= 

       *Have fun doing this...*
** How To Export/Publish to PDF File:

The *In-Buffer Settings* specified by the setupfiles above will get this file looking good when exported as a Standard PDF file.  Once you have your project directory all set up as above you are ready to export your first PDF as a test run...

   #+begin_src conf
      M-x org-latex-export-to-pdf
   #+end_src
   =-or-= If You Enabled *Xah-Fly-Keys Command Mode* Try:
   #+begin_src conf
      SPACE e p
   #+end_src

After *AucTeX* is done parsing/compiling etc., a new *PDF* by the name of ~My-New-Audio-Drama.pdf~ -and- ~My-New-Audio-Drama.tex~ will appear within this project's directory...

Subsequent repeated calls to the above command will overwrite your existing ~My-New-Audio-Drama.pdf~ -and- ~My-New-Audio-Drama.tex~ files! /(make backups first if needed! - I put backups in the auto directory)/

** Instructions for Exporting Fountain Scripts:

Fountain screenplay scripts created within this project can be exported using the *afterwriting* python tool... Follow Instructions section below under the *Instructions / Fountain 2 PDF:* section for more about how to do that...

*This README was Last Modified On:* <2021-08-22 Sun> So far things are pretty basic PDF... We will get fancy with other formats later... I promice... I have to do all this documentation first! /(As you can see, if you been following for the past couple years, things are getting done! Albeit Slowly)/

Enjoy! - Alisha Awen

*** Fountain 2 PDF

The ~Audio-Drama~ project folder that contains this file also contains external files for exporting the project's fountain script(s) to a PDF file formatted to HAP Radio Drama Script style. Instructions and info for further customizations of your final output follow...

I am now employing Afterwriting to perform the conversion and export job... No longer needing to dip into the LaTeX bowels for screenplays... Thank God!

[[https://github.com/ifrost/afterwriting-labs/blob/master/docs/clients.md]]

I plan to interface Emacs org-mode with afterwriting to produce output PDFs with just a few keystrokes while editing this file in Emacs...

Before using this you must have afterwriting globally installed on your machine using NPM

Install afterwriting globally on your machine: (assuming you already have Node.js npm installed & updated to latest LTS):

Most of the information below under the first sections starting with Afterwriting config file: was copied (reprinted from original markdown) from: Github:ifrost/afterwriting-labs/CLI Tool therefore due credit goes to ifrost for most of the instructions below...

The sections below where I begin using the information above to customize my own config.json file are my own... Based on much trial and error, as well as reading other docs on the fountain.org website...

**** Generic Afterwriting Config File

The output can be customized using configuration file passed as --config parameter. Config should be a JSON with this structure:

  #+begin_src js
    {
        "embolden_scene_headers": false,
        "show_page_numbers": true,
        "split_dialogue": true,

* 💡 Ideas Scratchpad Refile                         :noexport:
** NEW ☞ Start Here!
:README:
  This section is intended to help you quickly capture inspired at-the-moment ideas While they are still fresh in mind...

  Use this *Ideas / Scratchpad / Refile* section as a quick place to instantly document ideas and inspirations as soon as they come up!  You can refile them later... /(even if it is intended for elsewhere)/ Parallel universe? Sure... You got that covered. %^)

    - [ ] =Come directly here=

    - [ ] Advance your cursor a few newlines below this ~:README:~ drawer 
           on a fresh clean line with some extra space below it as well... 
           /(above any previously time stamped entries you may already/ 
           /have placed)/

    - [ ] You are now at the top of the list and the time is the present...  

           There won't be any future entries ahead of you... 
           /(maybe next decade? time travel?)/

    - [ ] Enter a new timestamp with: ~C-c .~ Then finish the command by 
           pressing ~enter~ to auto accept today's date and time.

    - [ ] Give your new Time Stamped Entry a =Title= and make this new time 
           stamped title into an outline heading at the proper level. 
           /(There is already an example provided as an example)/

    - [ ] Advance your cursor two lines below your new heading and begin 
           typing away before you forget your fantastic idea!!!

  =Organize everything else later...= 

  Don't scare away the muses! Get your story down now!

  After initial Inspiration quiets down, then and you will be ready for a change to more organized like activities...

  Or... go out to play elsewhere little grasshopper... But come back later and organize things here... OK? Don't create a swamp in here! And don't forget to take your bath tonight... ;-) 

  Having done the simple steps above any time you get inspired, you will be able to tell your grand children.. /"I got my first spark of an idea for that book back/ /in Year, Month, Day, time, second"/ (50 years later!) Now that is being organized! LOL
:END:

*** NEW <2020-06-07 Sun> New Episode / Scene Idea
:README:
  This is a dummy example of some crazy idea that you may have gotten at the spur of the moment, while you were doing something elsewhere within this project...  

  You may simply use this first time stamped heading for your own use... =Change it!!!=  

  After you are done getting as much of your new idea as you initally can then you can simply go back to what you were doing before the inspiration segue tore you away... you might want to schedule this as a todo item before leaving though...

  Later when you are free you can come back to file this or place it where it belongs.

**** NEW 📢 Sound Cues:
***** Sound Cue /(clips)/ Numbering Convention:

The numbering and naming of sound cues for an entire audio drama project are limited to the scope of that project alone. Other projects may have similar or even the same sequence of sound cue names and numbers, but they are also only local to the scope of their project alone... 

Therefore all sound files shall be kept in their accompanying project's ~media~ sub folder and not get mixed up into other projects or else confusion could arise!!! 

All sound files should contain the unique /(within its project)/ number below, plus a descriptive but short title... /(this way sound files can be sorted alphabetically and found easily when called for in a script (or cue sheet) during rehearsal or production time...)/

Its easy to call out these cues during a rehearsal... For instance, simply saying: /"SFX 102, 12, 25"/ and everyone will know we are talking about Episode 102, Scene 12, Cue 25...

**** NEW 🎙Scenes
:README:
   Here is the ultimate master source where you create and update your scenes...

   All ideas, plots, dialog, sounds, music, production notes, etc. for a particular scene within this episode are developed here solely...

   One of the accompanying fountain drama scripts for this *Audio Drama Project* ~.org~ file /(named after this episode)/ contains a compilation of all the /fountain script snippits/ for all scenes developed within this single episode...

   Some elements created here will become part of the accompanying fountain drama script for this episode... /(e.g., dialog, notes, narration, etc.)/ 

   The accompanying fountain drama script for this episode must be kept up to date with final drafts and latest edits made solely here...

   The headings within this ~.org~ file can be tracked using ~GTD~ tags, and a *log* entry can keep track of time worked on them... Once a scene is in final draft stage, it can be marked *DONE* and the fountain script for the episode will be updated to reflect that scene's final draft state...

   *What is a Scene?*

   Scenes form the fabric within episodes of audio or radio programs...

   Scenes are small packages of isolated events relating to a single unique thread/picture knitted into a defined situation where particular events related to that situation play out...

   The scenes don't necessarily follow in chronological order but they relate to each other in the mosaic fabric of the story as it develops... 

   If a scene changes abruptly to some other situation, that may mean that the scene is over and a new one is starting... Usually a change of environment triggers a new scene...
:END:

   Use this space to add time stamped log note entries for any pourpose you may need...

   *To create a Time Stamped Entry, Use Key Command:* ~C-c .~

   Make your new entry a =sub-heading under a Log section= heading /(as above but, wherever else you may need a collection of log entries)/.

   Keep your Log Entries in Decending Chronological Order. /(i.e., put your newest entries on top)/

   This serves as a replacement for my Scrivener planning Logs /(Currently implemented as markdown files outside of Scrivener)/... Each ~Org-based~ Writing project will have one or more of these logs right inside of it close to the things the logs are actually about...  No more fumbling and guessing which log was I useing for what? Now, not only can I find them, I can make them into tasks, TODOS, and prioritize them to boot! Consider this my new official general template for logs going forward...

:END:
*** NEW LOG: <2021-03-29 Mon> Generic Title /(General Log Entry Template)/
:README:
   - *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:* /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

      =Punch the Time Clock= At the heading And then begin working on a task related to that Heading... =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= 

   - =Use These Commands:= /as you work to keep track your time.../

      + *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ 

                    /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

                    This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
                    underneath the HEADING...

                    Do this just before starting work on the task... 
                    Be in control of your life!

                    After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
                    work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
                    other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
                    be recording your time all the while... You will see 
                    in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
                    as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
                    and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

                        /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

                        You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
                        while and you need to come back to update the item's
                        info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
                        do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

                      This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
                      ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the/ 
                      /clock)/...

                      The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

                      =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e.,
                      Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse,
                      leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it
                      again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do/
                      /you want to do with this?"/ If you do something like 
                      that you can always come back and directly edit the 
                      clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing 
                      clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

                      ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

                  This command will change the total time at the end showing 
                  your new calculated time...

                  If you need to go away and do something else before finishing this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

            When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
            command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
            /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
            /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
            So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
            marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
            /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
            /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

                      This removes currently running clock and forgets 
                      any time accrued or associated with it...

      + ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

                      /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
                      =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                                within your org file with those timestamps!!!

   - Once all of this has become routine for you, =go ahead and remove this= ~README~ =drawer from this template=... That way it does not get copied when you need to clone new log entries...

   This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content, then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what you were looking for... 

   Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

   Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...

* ⎘ Meta: /(templates etc.)/                                    :noexport:
** Introduction:

This =Meta= section provides skeleton templates for use within your project(s).  Any sub heading under this Meta: group can be utilized by copy-pasting the collapsed heading into any of your existing project sections (i.e., making a clone anywhere you need to create a new section based on the template's structure)... 

Or... You could try mashing several cloned templates together to create a totally new project heading with a totally different structure... The intent of this is to save lots of time starting up a new custom writing project.  Lets see if it helps. :trollface:

\newpage

** Instructions:

- Choose one of the templates below and copy it (folded).  

- Paste the copied template as a new clone within your project's Production, or Research section, or under a heading where it should belong...  

- Change the name of your copied template to a specific title needed to fit in with Its purpose...

:README:
  This section is for episode background planning and plot development which may or may not be included within the final production... Information contained here is more specific to this single episode than the more general *Synopsis / Back Story* section of this entire project, or what you may find within the *Research:* section which is more global in scope as well...

  Structure this section any way you wish or need...
:END:

\newpage

**** NEW 📃 Epi Synopsis
:README:
  Write a short synopsis for this single episode here... This will be more or less a summary of this single episode only... You can use similar story building tools / exercises for writing this synopsis as you do for any typical fiction writing project... A summary of your Synopsis will be added to the final draft fountain script...

**** NEW 📢 Sound Cues:
***** Sound Cue /(clips)/ Numbering Convention:

The numbering and naming of sound cues for an entire audio drama project are limited to the scope of that project alone. Other projects may have similar or even the same sequence of sound cue names and numbers, but they are also only local to the scope of their project alone... 

Therefore all sound files shall be kept in their accompanying project's ~media~ sub folder and not get mixed up into other projects or else confusion could arise!!! 

All sound files should contain the unique /(within its project)/ number below, plus a descriptive but short title... /(this way sound files can be sorted alphabetically and found easily when called for in a script (or cue sheet) during rehearsal or production time...)/

Its easy to call out these cues during a rehearsal... For instance, simply saying: /"SFX 102, 12, 25"/ and everyone will know we are talking about Episode 102, Scene 12, Cue 25...

**** NEW 🎙Scenes
:README:
   Here is the ultimate master source where you create and update your scenes...

   All ideas, plots, dialog, sounds, music, production notes, etc. for a particular scene within this episode are developed here solely...

   One of the accompanying fountain drama scripts for this *Audio Drama Project* ~.org~ file /(named after this episode)/ contains a compilation of all the /fountain script snippits/ for all scenes developed within this single episode...

   Some elements created here will become part of the accompanying fountain drama script for this episode... /(e.g., dialog, notes, narration, etc.)/ 

   The accompanying fountain drama script for this episode must be kept up to date with final drafts and latest edits made solely here...

   The headings within this ~.org~ file can be tracked using ~GTD~ tags, and a *log* entry can keep track of time worked on them... Once a scene is in final draft stage, it can be marked *DONE* and the fountain script for the episode will be updated to reflect that scene's final draft state...

   *What is a Scene?*

   Scenes form the fabric within episodes of audio or radio programs...

   Scenes are small packages of isolated events relating to a single unique thread/picture knitted into a defined situation where particular events related to that situation play out...

   The scenes don't necessarily follow in chronological order but they relate to each other in the mosaic fabric of the story as it develops... 

   If a scene changes abruptly to some other situation, that may mean that the scene is over and a new one is starting... Usually a change of environment triggers a new scene...

*** NEW LOG: <2021-03-29 Mon> Generic Title /(General Log Entry Template)/
:README:
   - *Go To One of the HEADINGS Below:* /(Summary, Details, or Sub Headings)/

      =Punch the Time Clock= At the heading And then begin working on a task related to that Heading... =Your Time IS being Recorded Now= 

   - =Use These Commands:= /as you work to keep track your time.../

      + *Clock IN:* ~C-c C-x C-i~ 

                    /(Begin OR Resume Clocking Current task)/

                    This creates a new :CLOCKING: Time Card Entry just
                    underneath the HEADING...

                    Do this just before starting work on the task... 
                    Be in control of your life!

                    After doing the above, you can go away and do some 
                    work, leaving this heading, log note, etc. to visit 
                    other files and/or work on them etc. The clock will 
                    be recording your time all the while... You will see 
                    in your mode line the elapsed clock time ticking away 
                    as you work on a task /(hopefully related to this clock!)/
                    and NOT Yac Shaving or being sidetracked!!!

      + *RETURN to Clock Heading:* ~C-c C-x C-j~

                        /Go back to the place where you started the clock.../

                        You do this after you have worked on a task for a 
                        while and you need to come back to update the item's
                        info etc., and/or stop the clock before going off to 
                        do something else unrelated to the log entry...

      + *Clock OUT:* ~C-c C-x C-o~ /(to stop clocking your time on task)/

                      This *Finalizes the Time Card Entry* within:
                      ~:CLOCKING:~ /(created earlier when you started the/ 
                      /clock)/...

                      The Clock Entry changes showing start timestamp, end timestamp, and total time worked during this segment...  

                      =Please DON'T Forget= /Like I often do, LOL.../ i.e.,
                      Leaving a clock running all day by accident, or worse,
                      leave it dangling with the file closed only to open it
                      again and get that nasty *Org-Mode Message:* /"What do/
                      /you want to do with this?"/ If you do something like 
                      that you can always come back and directly edit the 
                      clock times by hand to amend them...  After changing 
                      clock times or dates, etc... Whatever...

                      ="Onward We Row Mates... Through the log jam!"=

      + *Update Time Card Entry:* ~C-c C-c~ 

                  This command will change the total time at the end showing 
                  your new calculated time...

                  If you need to go away and do something else before finishing this task, you can do so after clocking out... When you come back simply clock back in again to start another Time Card Entry just as before... The new time card entry will appear above the earlier one within the ~:CLOCKING:~ drawer... When you clock out of this task it will look just like the entry below it with a total time worked tagged on the end...

      + *Clock Out & Mark Items Done:* ~C-c C-t~

            When you are all done with a Log Entry use the above key 
            command to mark its Heading *TODO* tag to: *DONE* /(Most of the/ 
            /time this will ALSO clock you out if you are still clocked/ 
            /into the item... But not allways in my experience.../  
            So make sure you are also clocked OUT of an Item After 
            marking it DONE... Type: ~C-c C-x C-j~ to check this...
            /(if no running clock it will tell you and place your/
            /cursor at the heading where you LAST CLOCKED OUT)/

      + ~C-c C-x C-q~ *Cancel Current Clock:* /(in case of accident)/

                      This removes currently running clock and forgets 
                      any time accrued or associated with it...

      + ~C-c C-x C-d~ *Display Clocking Info:* 

                      /This will show elapsed times to the right of headings.../
                      =Warning!= Using this command will CLUTTER ALL the headings
                                within your org file with those timestamps!!!

   - Once all of this has become routine for you, =go ahead and remove this= ~README~ =drawer from this template=... That way it does not get copied when you need to clone new log entries...

   This Summary is mostly to help you find things later when you cannot remember when or where is was done... If you go to the top of this file and expand all headings to show ALL content, then do a search on "~Summary:~" you will be able to quickly scroll through and scan these summaries quickly to find what you were looking for... 

   Also the *Time Card* /displayed above/ each search hit will give more clues by showing important headings you worked on...

   Below is an optional list /(that could also provide links)./ This list could be used to itemize things you worked on, but I personally find it easier to simply write a short one or two line description containing important keywords right here and nothing more. I think that is more useful...
