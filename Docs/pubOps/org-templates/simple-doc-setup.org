=Usage:= *Copy/Clone* this file and adjust to suit your needs...
       *Include* this SETUPFILE within ~.org~ files destined to become
       a *Short General Purpose Document*...

       *COPY/CLONE:* ~~/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ directory
       to the MASTER directory where existing .org files reference
       this contained SETUPFILE... Modify the copied SETUP Files within
       your cloned org-templates directory to suit your needs...

       =Don't Modify The MASTER Templates Within ~/.emacs.d=

       /(if you did by accident, you can easily enough perform:/
       
            ~git restore <this file>~

            =or:= ~git checkout .~

        /to refresh ALL since you are not modifying the master branch...)/

       =Add:= The following line to the Header of ~.Org~ Files that need to
            include this file:

               ~#+SETUPFILE: ./org-templates/simple-doc-setup.org~

/Making a COPY/CLONE of:/ ~$HOME/.emacs.d/Docs/pubOps/org-templates~ /master folder To your book's project directory will allow you to make your own custom configurations for different books or other docs, without affecting the configurations of other book projects within their own MASTER FOLDERS.../

=NOTE:= The Configurations within this file depend on Harmonic Alchemy Modular
      Emacs init file: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/modules/09-4-org-export-conf.el~...

      If you need to create other LaTeX Document Styles or customize existing
      ones, you will also need to override ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~
      by placing a copy of it within: ~~/.emacs.d/lisp/my-modules~ and then
      make your changes in your cloned copy...

      Find the: ~BEGIN: CUSTOM LaTeX CONFIGURATIONS for EXPORT to PDF~
      heading within that file... You can modify or add new configurations and
      even ~\\input~ external LaTeX files with even more fancy modifications...
      It's a LOT of work, /(research)/ but worth it in the end when you have
      something looking really nice!

=This configuration uses the SIMPLE DOCUMENT CLASS= defined within:
~09-4-org-export-conf.el~ as: ~simple~ for its *LaTeX* Configuration...

=For Local Customizing:= You will have to edit your local CLONED copy of: ~09-4-org-export-conf.el~... /(as per above NOTE...)/

Find the ~"simple"~ section within ~org-latex-classes~ list, and change anything after the first ~\\~ Indicating the beginning of *LaTeX* directives that have to be escaped within an eLisp list...  You could also /(and I am going to as well)/ move all that embedded
*LaTeX* code =OUT OF lisp=, and into its own ~.tex~ file where it belongs! Using the ~\\input~
line to reference the file as the only "data" for that elisp list and you can close quote... You are done with the eLisp part... A lot cleaner code too!  Mixing both languages together like that is an insult to both languages mutually... IMHO...  But as you see I cheated for this first round...  Quick and dirty... maybe not quick... LOL

By the time you read this I may have already done the above, /(but forgot to update this
doc)/ Sorry... =Please Let me know with an open ISSUE on GitHub=... Thanks!

Once you have tried this several times to customize your LaTeX /(and failed)/ it won't look so complicated and you will begin to "get it"... /(Be Diligent! TeX/LaTeX IS a complicated Turing Complete Language... Created by one of the Geekiest GEEKS of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Algorithm Analysis! Donald Knuth... You have been warned!!!)/

=Good luck!=

=HOWTO Org-Mode LaTeX Tip:=

Prevent Headlines from Showing Up in the *TOC* by seting any *HEADING* within your ~.org~ project file with the following *:PROPERTIES:* BOX...

- *Set The NOTOC Property:* /(NOT in TOC)/

     ~*~ =ANY Section HEADING:=
     *:PROPERTIES:*
:       :NOTOC: t
     *:END:*

Don't copy this pretty text example... It is NOT code... LOL
